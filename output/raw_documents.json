Ahead of the defenders, a central-midfield pair operates in\nthe next line, with a high attacking line of four just ahead. It is typically\nan aggressive front line, as a result of the wingers or wide midfielders\nstarting and remaining very high, either side of the centre-forwards.\n\n## What are the origins of the 4-2-4 formation?\n\nIt is thought the initial development of the 4-2-4 came in the 1940s and\n1950s, from the work of Hungarian coach M\u00e1rton Bukovki. At that time Hungary\nwas at the forefront of world football; Bukovki adapted the widespread 3-2-2-3\nshape \u2013 better known as the W-M formation (below) \u2013 by having his centre-\nforward drop, while the two inside forwards advanced to create a front-line\npairing.\n\nThe left and right half-backs also adjusted, with one dropping into the back\nline to provide extra defensive cover, and the other working alongside the\nwithdrawn centre-forward. The outside left and outside right widened, to\ncomplete the front line of four (below).\n\nBela Guttmann, Bukovki\u2019s fellow Hungarian, is also credited with a substantial\nrole in the progression to a 4-2-4. A coach at 19 different clubs in 10\ncountries, he won 10 league titles, notably winning two European Cups at\nBenfica. It was in Brazil, however, that Guttmann really pioneered the 4-2-4,\nwith far fewer rotations and movements than had previously been the case.\n\nDuring his spell in charge of S\u00e3o Paulo, Guttman was assisted by Vincente\nFeola as the club won the 1957 Campeonato Paulista. A year later, Feola was\nmanager of Brazil when they swept to World Cup victory using a 4-2-4;\nadaptations of which they would go on to use in becoming world champions\nagain, in 1962 and 1970. M\u00e1rio Zagallo, who played for Brazil in the 1958 and\n1962 tournaments, carried the baton as coach for the 1970 success.\n\nMore recently, in the 2020s the W-M made a significant return to top-level\nfootball \u2013 especially in the Premier League. There, the 4-2-4 has often been\nused when defending, with teams forming 4-2-4 mid-blocks and high blocks to\ncombat opposition 3-2-2-3 formations adopted during build-up (below).\n\n## What are the in-possession responsibilities in a 4-2-4?\n\nA team playing 4-2-4 will have significant numbers in attacking positions,\noften directly up against an opposition back line. This provides options for\nattacking combinations. The two centre-forwards must be able to work off one\nanother, complimenting the other\u2019s movement \u2013 for example, one penetrating and\none dropping. Both should provide a goalscoring threat in central areas, and\nalso link up with either wide player \u2013 as well as each other \u2013 to outplay\ntheir centre-back markers.\n\nA 4-2-4 places a greater emphasis on 1v1s in wide areas. Advancing wide\nmidfielders or wingers provide the width, and the centre-forwards occupy the\nopposing centre-backs. The wide attackers should be strong dribblers, able to\nentice or beat players before providing crosses, through balls, switches or\ncombinations back inside. They should also provide a secondary goal threat, by\nattacking the back post or cutting inside.\n\nMohamed Salah is an excellent example of the profile of a wide attacker/winger\nwho can thrive in a 4-2-4 **Getty Images**\n\nThe central-midfield pair are often stretched in this formation, and therefore\nmust be athletic enough to cover large distances in the middle of the pitch.\nIt is crucial that, between them, they manage their distances in possession,\nto be able to combine with each other. They must also possess a range of\npassing, as short passes forward may not always be available. Breaking lines\nwith penetrative passes, or direct switches of play, becomes more important\nfor a central-midfield pair in this system.\n\nThe full-backs are less offensive in the 4-2-4 because of the presence of\nattackers already in the wide areas. Instead, they support from deeper\npositions with few runs beyond, drifting or driving inside to help assist the\ncentral midfielders. Should the wingers maintain maximum width, being\nnarrowed helps the full-backs to pass forward, before continuing to support\njust inside.\n\nThe two centre-backs provide forward passes into midfield, but with such an\naggressive front line they also have opportunities to play forward more\ndirectly. This typically includes switches of play into the wingers, or balls\nfor them to chase in behind. Direct central passes into the centre-forwards\nare also an option, from which the front line can pin and connect.\n\n## What are the out-of-possession responsibilities in a 4-2-4?\n\nThe 4-2-4 can be used with an aggressive pressing strategy or as a mid-block\n(below). In a withdrawn block, the front line can screen and cover access into\nthe opposition\u2019s central players, forcing play around the outside shoulder of\nthe wingers. The centre-forwards often screen access into opposing pivots,\nwith the wingers ready to jump when opponents creep forward with the ball,\nusually pressing out to in.\n\nThe central-midfield pair protect ahead of the back line. They often focus on\nthe opposition\u2019s number eight and number 10, being player-oriented with their\nmarking when necessary. Should the centre be breached by a pass through the\nfirst line, they are often required to engage in direct duelling.\n\nThe back line should remain as compact as possible for as long as possible,\nencouraging play wide. The centre-backs often have cover and protection ahead\nof them thanks to the midfield pair, but are required to maintain a high back\nline to shorten distances between the lines. The more they do this, the easier\nit is for the 4-2-4 to force and keep the ball away from central spaces. That\nmeans the full-backs are often required to defend 1v1. They must be strong in\ntheir duelling, cover access back inside and block crosses.\n\nWhen pressing (below), the 4-2-4 makes use of the front line, often going\nplayer\u2013for-player against the opposing back line. The two centre-forwards\npress directly on to the centre-backs. One should be available to press the\ngoalkeeper, while also cutting access off to the centre-back they are marking.\nThe wingers press the full-backs, usually forcing play wide to make use of the\ntouchline as an extra defender.\n\nDuring a high press, it is important that the far-side winger narrows to stop\nany attempted play into the opposite inside channel, or reversed passes played\nthrough the middle of the press. When up against a central midfield trio \u2013\nsuch as a 4-3-3 \u2013 this narrowed winger can help mark, track and defend the\nmidfielder furthest from the ball. The two central midfielders in the 4-2-4\ncan then be player-oriented in their marking. Otherwise, one of the back line\n\u2013 usually a centre-back \u2013 will have to push up to defend in the midfield.\n\nThe central midfielders in a 4-2-4 can player-mark or apply zonal cover to the\nmiddle of the pitch. They are usually responsible for pressing the deepest\nopposing players in this space. If the full-back hasn\u2019t jumped in an\naggressive manner to support the winger\u2019s press, then the closest central\nmidfielder may be needed to delay opposition progress by covering wider. Their\nmidfield partner should then slide across.\n\nAs with the wingers, the full-backs will often press from out to in. This\nworks to keep the ball on one side of the pitch where possible, locking it\nalong the touchline. When defending in a block, the full-backs must be strong\n1v1 defenders. The centre-backs should be agile and flexible enough to duel in\nmidfield, but also provide secondary cover just inside the full-back\u2019s press.\nIndeed, the entire back line\u2019s ability to shift across the pitch is key to a\n4-2-4 press.\n\n## Examples of teams using a 4-2-4\n\n## Roberto De Zerbi at Sassuolo, Shakhtar Donetsk, Brighton and Marseille\n\nDe Zerbi\u2019s teams have often utilised a 4-2-4 when executing his unique style\nof build-up. He places his double pivot very narrow and close to his centre-\nbacks. There, they can play regular, short bounce passes between the units.\nThe wingers operate extremely high, pinning the opposing full-backs deep while\nthe two centre-forwards perform opposite movements (below). This creates room\nfor the full-backs to receive on the move, as they bait and entice a press\nbefore linking into the very high and aggressive front line.\n\n## Antonio Conte with Italy, Chelsea and Inter\n\nAlthough Conte has often used a back three, in possession his rotations and\nattacking ideas have frequently formed a 4-2-4 structure. He had some success\ndoing this with the Italian national team and Inter, but reverted to a 3-4-2-1\nat Chelsea after making a poor start with the 4-2-4.\n\nThe deeper pivot in a Conte team often drops into the back line with the three\ncentre-backs. The two number eights then become connectors to the front line,\nwith the wing-backs very attacking and high up the pitch (below). Here, they\ncan work alongside the centre-forward pair (below).\n\n## Arne Slot\u2019s Liverpool\n\nIn the opening months of his tenure at Liverpool, Slot has used a 4-2-4 when\nattacking _and_ defending. His wingers \u2013 particularly Mohamed Salah \u2013 start\nhigh, wide and aggressive. In fact, direct passes from the back line have\nskipped the midfield and gone straight into the wingers, with a midfield\nrunner positioned early around the centre-forward to complete a front line of\nfour (below). Slot has also encouraged a second midfielder runner from deep,\nwhen appropriate. This gives Liverpool a strong attacking presence.\n\n## What are the benefits of playing with a 4-2-4?\n\nThe 4-2-4 features significant numbers high up the pitch, directly against the\nopposition back line. Without the need for rotations, the 4-2-4 places an\nimmediate threat in the final third. It facilitates attacks through direct\nplay, counter-attacks or sustained possession. Against a back four, it\nencourages multiple 1v1s; wingers who can beat their direct opponents thus\noffer an instant advantage. If the centre-forwards dominate their opponents \u2013\nthrough pinning to receive, clever movement or just outplaying them on the\nball and finishing \u2013 then the 4-2-4 can provide a high goal return.\n\nThe front four can also provide aggressive counter-pressing high up the pitch.\nThis puts opposition defenders under immediate pressure if they regain the\nball. With an organised press, the numbers and positioning in a 4-2-4 can\nregain the ball in the opposing half, while also disrupting the opposition\u2019s\ndeeper build-up. When the front line offers aggressive pressing and duelling,\nthe 4-2-4 can prove an effective shape.\n\nAnother positive of the 4-2-4 is that one subtle movement can create different\nshapes, structures and ideas. A dropping centre-forward serves to form a\n4-2-3-1. If this movement is diagonal, then a central midfielder can adjust to\nform a 4-3-3 (below). Wingers moving towards the ball, or just starting\ndeeper, can quickly form a flatter 4-4-2. With this flexibility, a team can\nadapt quickly. Players can have licence to problem-solve more than in some\nother structures.\n\nDepending on how far back the wingers recover out of possession, the 4-2-4 can\npose a significant counter-attacking threat, should the front unit stay\nrelatively high. If the defensive unit and central midfield have stopped an\nopposition attack, the front unit has width, height and the potential to\nrotate. These are all crucial to a successful counter-attack.\n\n## What are the disadvantages to playing with a 4-2-4?\n\nA central-midfield pair can be quickly overloaded. If the front line don\u2019t\nmaintain possession well, then the central spaces are ripe for transitions.\nThis is especially the case if full-back support or cover hasn\u2019t been\nestablished by the 4-2-4. It can therefore be easier to counter-attack into\nthe defensive half of a team playing in a 4-2-4.\n\nIf the back line\u2019s forward passing isn\u2019t successful, gaps can be exploited on\nthe second phase of the play. Without shorter support around the ball, a loss\nof possession can be particularly damaging due to the distances between the\nunits.\n\nWide movements from opposition full-backs and wingers can also exploit the\nmost obvious space when attacking a 4-2-4. Teams can adapt in possession, with\nattacking midfielders widening and not being tracked. There, they can receive\nto then attack back inside. This has become a growing trend in the Premier\nLeague, since the 4-2-4 has been used as a defensive response to the in\npossession 3-2-2-3.\n\n_To learn more from professional coaches, visit  CV Academy_\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### Birmingham City Under-16: Runs in behind \u2013 Midfield & defensive unit work\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Downloadable session plans\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Coaching Sessions\n\nMBP Coaches' School\n\n### Specialist in Set Pieces\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

This pair forms the base of the\nmidfield unit, which is usually a box shape. Further ahead in the central\nareas are two attacking midfielders, who try to position themselves between\nlines, completing the midfield box. One player operates in each wide area,\nworking either side of a single centre-forward.\n\nThe 3-2-4-1 formation can operate as a fixed structure, with three centre-\nbacks forming the back line, and two wing-backs working around the midfield\nfour and central striker (below). However, a growing trend in the modern game\ninvolves teams attacking with a 3-2-4-1 but defending with a back four. This\nrequires at least one of the back line to move into a new position when\nattacking, with the remainder of the back line swinging around to form a\nthree.\n\n## How did the 3-2-4-1 originate?\n\nThe 3-2-4-1 formation is essentially the modern version of the W-M formation,\nwhich Herbert Chapman\u2019s Arsenal popularised with their success in the 1930s.\nThe W-M added another defender to counteract increasing attacking numbers at\nthat time \u2013 a result of a change in the offside law. Later, teams playing\nback-five systems used a 3-2-4-1 when attacking. That meant wing-backs\nadvancing forward and working around a central midfield box when attacking,\nbut reverting to a 5-4-1 or 5-2-3 shape when defending (below).\n\nIn the 2020s the 3-2-4-1 emerged again, with coaches who want their team to\ndefend with a back four but attack using a back three. This can mean one\ndefender advances from the back line, such as a full-back inverting into\nmidfield. Or it can be two players \u2013 usually full-backs - advancing from the\nback line at the same time. In that case, a single player \u2013 usually the\ndeepest central midfielder \u2013 moves the opposite way, dropping in between or\nalongside the remaining centre-backs.\n\nThe rest of the midfield and forward unit then readjust to form a box of four\nin midfield, operating between a front three and the back line. Both Pep\nGuardiola and Marcelo Bielsa are modern examples of coaches who have used\nthese methods to convert a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 into a 3-2-4-1 attacking shape.\n\n## What are the in-possession responsibilities in a 3-2-4-1?\n\nThe 3-2-4-1 places significant attacking numbers directly up against the\nopposing back line. The single centre-forward can operate between two centre-\nbacks, which allows two attacking midfielders to make forward runs and combine\nin the inside channels, providing crosses and shots.\n\nThe wingers stretch the opposing back line across the pitch. They attack from\nthe wide areas, providing crosses, attacking combinations and sometimes shots\nafter cutting back inside.\n\nWith the front three often pinning the opposing back line, the two attacking\nmidfielders also have licence to drop, to rotate and connect with deeper\nplayers (below). This can help overload the opposition\u2019s central-midfield\nunit, allowing for lots of short passes and attacking combinations to help\nprogress up the pitch.\n\nThe double pivot supports underneath the attack. Along with the two attacking\nmidfielders, the pivots can assist with dominating the ball in the central\nspaces. They are the link between the back three and the rest of the attacking\nunit, collecting passes under pressure to then progress play with a range of\npassing.\n\nThe back three support the goalkeeper with deeper build-up when a team\u2019s style\nis short passes through the thirds. The widest of the three often have space\nto drive into, so they will frequently carry the ball forward. The middle\ncentre-back often drops deeper to help pass the ball across the pitch, or away\nfrom pressure. If a team builds more directly, the back three have the\nopportunity to deliver longer passes or switches of play, often direct to the\nwingers or centre-forward.\n\n## What are the out-of-possession responsibilities in a 3-2-4-1?\n\nAs the 3-2-4-1 is more of an attacking shape, it converts into various\ndefensive structures, with either a high-pressing strategy or more cautious\nmid and low blocks. The centre-forward can lead the press by locking play one\nway, as the rest of the team shuffles across to force the ball down one side\nof the pitch (below). Alternatively, the centre-forward can play a more\nreserved screening role, to block central passing lanes and cover or intercept\npasses through the middle.\n\nThe wide players support a high press by jumping alongside the centre-forward.\nThe winger opposite to the ball will often narrow, giving further compactness\nin the centre to limit attempted switches of play.\n\nThe wide players may also recover back into a deeper defensive position,\nespecially if an opposition full-back has advanced in attack. This can help\nform a four-player back line. Should both wide players recover back, they help\nto form a back five, often in a deeper block (below). The wide players then\nfocus on blocking crosses and stopping passes into the penalty area.\n\nA winger who inverted when attacking can move back out wide to defend, leaving\ntwo or three players in the midfield unit to defend the central spaces. This\nis often player-oriented defending, as well as covering and screening.\n\nShould the midfield unit of four remain, then the attacking midfielders can\nrelease to support high pressing in place of the wide players. The two deeper\nmidfielders support the press as the second line, often moving wider to help\nlock the play one way. Alternatively, they aggressively jump on to straight\npasses into midfield, with the attacking midfielders back-pressing and\nsandwiching the opposing midfielder trying to receive (below).\n\nAs with all defences, the back three should remain as compact as possible for\nas long as possible, encouraging or forcing play away from goal. The three\ncentre-backs often have cover and protection ahead, thanks to the double\npivot. The wide areas, however, are often vacant \u2013 especially during\ntransition \u2013 meaning that the widest players in the back line may have to\ndefend towards the touchline for longer.\n\nWhen supporting a high press, the back three may also need to be player-\noriented with their marking against a front three. That places increased\nemphasis on their individual duelling and 1v1 defending. When teammates\nrecover back into the defensive unit, to form either a back four or five, the\nfocus is on protecting the centre, forcing play away from goal and limiting\ngoalscoring opportunities.\n\n## Examples of teams using a 3-2-4-1\n\n## Unai Emery\u2019s Aston Villa\n\nUnder Unai Emery, Villa have typically defended in a 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1, but\nswitched to a back three in possession. He has encouraged one of his full-\nbacks \u2013 usually Lucas Digne \u2013 to advance and create the width on the left. The\nlikes of Jacob Ramsey, John McGinn, Nicol\u00f2 Zaniolo and Morgan Rogers have\nmoved inside from a wide-left starting position, as the number 10 readjusts\ninto the right inside channel. The double pivot remains fixed, completing the\nbox shape ahead of the back three, which moves across to the left (below).\n\n## Mikel Arteta\u2019s Arsenal\n\nMikel Arteta has often utilised a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, but converted it to a\n3-2-4-1 by moving a full-back into a pivot role, as opposed to them pushing\nhigh and wide. Oleksandr Zinchenko has often performed that role (below) \u2013\nalthough Myles Lewis-Skelly stepped into his boots in the 2024/25 season \u2013\nwith Arsenal\u2019s remaining back line swinging around. One of the midfielders\nthen bumps forward to become a second number 10 alongside Martin \u00d8degaard, who\nreadjusts accordingly.\n\n## Enzo Maresca\u2019s Chelsea\n\nEnzo Maresca has a history of encouraging a full-back to advance from the back\nline, whether to a high and wide position, or to form a double pivot. He has\nalso placed the likes of Malo Gusto and Marc Cucurella into one of the\nattacking midfield roles, working alongside Cole Palmer as the latter\nreadjusts into the right inside channel (below). In this case, the double\npivot remains fixed as the back line swings around. The front three remains\nintact, with the wingers holding the width (below).\n\n## Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City\n\nPep Guardiola has used many varieties and rotations to form a 3-2-4-1. Unlike\nmost coaches, he has often converted to a back three by pushing a centre-back\ninto the double pivot, alongside Rodri. Guardiola has used this option when\nhis back line has been made up of players with more of a centre-back profile,\nor he has had a full-back who is also comfortable at centre-back. The likes of\nKyle Walker, Nathan Ak\u00e9 and Manuel Akanji have all defended in full-back\nroles, before narrowing to form a back three as a centre-back moves into\nmidfield. John Stones (below), Fernandinho and Akanji have all advanced to\nplay alongside Rodri during the build phase. City have then bumped one of\ntheir midfielders higher as a second number 10, underneath the single centre-\nforward.\n\n## What are the benefits of playing with a 3-2-4-1?\n\nThe 3-2-4-1 places eight out of the 10 outfielders through the middle of the\npitch. As such, it is one of the few structures that has four players\npermanently in central midfield. This helps to overload and control the\nmidfield, bossing possession. From here, build-up from the back and regular\nattacks can occur via this central unit.\n\nWhen a team in a 3-2-4-1 loses possession, counter-pressing can immediately\nstop counter-attacks and work to regain possession quickly, courtesy of the\nfour players in central midfield. This supports quick counters when the\nopposition has just begun to open up. The presence of four central players in\nmidfield also helps with winning first and second balls, and dealing with\ndirect play.\n\nA team can form a 3-2-4-1 from different formations, with players moving into\nnew attacking roles. It also has enough flexibility for players to easily work\nthemselves into different positions to attack. That means coaches can use it\nto get the best out of the specific players they have available, rather than\nthe formation being rigid, with attacking options that don\u2019t suit the players.\n\nThis shape also lends itself to quickly forming aggressive high pressing, due\nto the numbers in attack. The front three, supported by the two attacking\nmidfielders, can put almost instant pressure on the opposition back line and\ndeeper midfielders. It is also a shape that can quickly form a compact block,\nespecially with three centre-backs and a double pivot protecting the middle\nfrom counter-attacks. With wide players recovering quickly, a team in a\n3-2-4-1 can form a significantly compact block, often before the opposition\nhave been able to create an attack.\n\n## What are the disadvantages of playing with a 3-2-4-1?\n\nCoaches have often used a 4-2-4 to nullify a team attacking in a 3-2-4-1. The\nfull-backs in a 4-2-4 defend the wingers in the 3-2-4-1, with both attacking\nmidfielders also tightly marked, by the opposing double pivot. The 4-2-4\u2019s\ncentre-backs overload the centre-forward, while their two wide players are\noften able to cut off wide access between the 3-2-4-1\u2019s centre-back and\nwingers. The two forwards in the 4-2-4 can then protect and cover access into\nthe double pivot of the 3-2-4-1, helping lock the ball down one side.\n\nThe wider of the three centre-backs in the 3-2-4-1 have to be extremely\nversatile and comfortable enough on the ball to outplay opponents.\nFurthermore, the distance between the wide centre-backs and their winger can\noften be stretched. A wide centre-back\u2019s option will often be long, straight\npasses into the winger, who can be locked along the touchline and forced back.\nThis can result in a fairly simple pressing trap where the 3-2-4-1 locks\nitself on one side. Additionally, in the absence of full-backs or wing-backs,\nif the wide centre-backs aren\u2019t comfortable or athletic enough to defend in\nthe wide areas, the back line can become stretched, isolated and exploited.\n\nThe wide players can be isolated in a 3-2-4-1. This places a big emphasis on\ntheir 1v1 play, especially ball-carrying, dribbling and duelling. The single\ncentre-forward, meanwhile, is usually up against two centre-backs. Unless they\nreceive regular service, they can also become isolated. And they can face a\ntough physical battle, as they must receive, hold, link and attack against two\nopponents.\n\nT _o learn more from professional coaches, visit  CV Academy_\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### David Wright, Norwich City U23: Developing principles of play\n\nOnline course\n\n### Master in High Performance Football\n\nCoaching Knowledge\n\n### The 4-2-4 formation: football tactics explained\n\nMasterclass\n\n### Enzo Maresca tactics exclusive\n\nCoach Watch\n\n### Unai Emery tactics and style of play\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

A single defensive midfielder operates just ahead,\nwith a second unit of four in a midfield line, comprising two central\nmidfielders and two wide midfielders. A single centre-forward then completes\nthe formation as the highest player (below).\n\n## What are the origins of the 4-1-4-1 formation?\n\nThe 4-1-4-1 formation isn\u2019t too dissimilar to a 4-3-3, as both operate with a\nback four and one defensive midfielder \u2013 sometimes referred to as a single\npivot, or a number six. With a 4-3-3, however, there are two wingers who\nattack much higher and often position themselves in line with the centre-\nforward. The distance between the full-back and winger is then increased,\ncreating more room for wide movements from the midfield. By contrast, the\n4-1-4-1 places the wide midfielders deeper, often connected closer to the rest\nof the midfield unit and the full-backs.\n\nThe 4-1-4-1 is mainly used in a defensive capacity, similar to the 4-5-1\nshape. The main difference with the former is the staggered nature of the\ncentral midfield unit, as opposed to the flat midfield line within the 4-5-1.\nWhen defending in a 4-1-4-1, the defensive midfielder protects the spaces\nbetween the lines, and rarely moves up to join the midfield unit of four.\n\nNaturally, the 4-1-4-1 often becomes a defensive component of the 4-3-3. The\nfirst real use of a 4-3-3 is often considered to be when Brazil\u2019s 1958 World\nCup winners converted their 4-2-4 system into a 4-3-3 shape as they attacked.\nWhen coaches began to adopt the 4-3-3 as a preferred attacking shape, dropping\nthe wingers when defending then formed the 4-1-4-1 structure (below).\n\n## What are the in-possession responsibilities of a 4-1-4-1?\n\nAs the 4-1-4-1 is very much a defensive shape, teams employing it will usually\nconvert into a 4-3-3 when attacking for prolonged periods. As well as scoring\nand creating goals, the centre-forward in the 4-1-4-1 must secure and maintain\npossession. This allows the wide midfielders to push higher, or the central\nmidfielders to run forward, forming the 4-3-3. A dropping centre-forward, such\nas a false nine, can also be used well in an initial 4-1-4-1 shape.\n\nThe central midfielders can provide penetrative movements when attacking,\noften running inside the wide midfielders. They may also narrow to become more\nof a number 10 underneath or around the central striker (below).\nAlternatively, one of the central midfielders can drop towards the ball to\nsupport a deeper build-up, forming a brief double pivot when required.\nUltimately, the three in central midfield are responsible for instigating\ncounter-attacks through forward passing, or maintaining possession to then\nenable the 4-1-4-1 to move into a new shape.\n\nThe wide midfielders are often the main outlet during counter-attacks, making\nforward runs in behind. However, as they are typically deeper than wingers in\na front three, they must progress the ball forward more with dribbles and\nball-carries. They also provide crosses for the central forward, opposite wide\nmidfielder and any central-midfield runners. Due to the depth of the central-\nmidfield unit, however, there is also space for them to move inside, both with\nand without the ball.\n\nThe full-backs provide earlier, secondary support in the wide areas,\nespecially with the wide midfielder not starting as high as a traditional\nwinger. This allows for more passing combinations compared with other\nstructures, with adapted movements based on those ahead and slightly inside.\n\nThe two centre-backs provide forward passes into the midfield unit, or more\ndirect passes into the wide areas for the wide midfielders to receive or run\non to. They can also drive into midfield via the inside channels, especially\nif the single pivot has dropped deeper or the central midfielders have vacated\nthe space.\n\n## What are the out-of-possession responsibilities of a 4-1-4-1?\n\nThe centre-forward will press on to the opposing centre-backs, attempting to\nforce the ball one way, most commonly outwards and towards the touchline, to\nlock the play. Alternatively, they can drop deeper and screen access into the\nopposition\u2019s pivot. This can then allow the central midfielders behind to take\nup more of a zonal defensive screen, better blocking access through the centre\nof the pitch.\n\nThe central-midfield trio can use player-oriented marking, or apply zonal\ncover to the central areas. The two central midfielders may be required to\njump out and support the forward\u2019s press, again helping lock the ball one way.\nThe sole responsibility of the single pivot \u2013 between the two units of four \u2013\nis to screen, cover, duel, intercept and protect that space ahead of the\ncentral defence.\n\nThe wide midfielders take up a narrowed defensive position to support the two\ncentral midfielders inside. They also support ahead of their full-back\nteammate, often tracking opposing full-back forward runs (below). Usually,\nthey will force the ball outwards, using the touchline as an extra defender.\nIdeally, once play has been locked on one side of the pitch, they should help\ntheir full-back block crosses and cut-back attempts.\n\nThe centre-backs have cover and protection ahead due to the presence of the\nsingle pivot, so they can focus more on the spaces behind. However, they may\nhave to individually jump forward to deal with balls into the feet of the\nopposing central forward \u2013 particularly to stop them from turning. In a more\nreserved block, the back four maintain compactness, shifting across as the\nteam locks the ball one way. Here, they are ready to drop back or squeeze up\nin relation to the movement of the ball and opposing runners.\n\n## Examples of teams using a 4-1-4-1\n\n## 1\\. Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City\n\nAlthough Pep Guardiola has focused on a 4-3-3 with Manchester City, he has\nalso used the very similar 4-1-4-1 shape (below) \u2013 especially in the period\nwhen he had no traditional centre-forward threat. When Phil Foden, Ilkay\nG\u00fcndogan, Riyad Mahrez, Raheem Sterling or Ferran Torres played as a false\nnine for City, the wide midfielders initially started deeper. Along with the\ntwo central midfielders, this helped cement a numerical overload in midfield.\nOnce the forward was fully connected, the wide midfielders and central\nmidfielders repositioned, often as traditional wingers with penetrative\nnumber-eight runs inside.\n\n## 2\\. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Tottenham Hotspur\n\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho often utilised mid and low blocks with Tottenham, with a 4-1-4-1\nblock stemming from their 4-3-3 attacking shape (below). Mourinho would often\nask his pivot(s) to remain in close contact with his centre-backs. Indeed,\nthere were occasions when his Spurs side ended up forming a back five \u2013 and\nsometimes even a back six \u2013 as the pivot(s) ended up dropping between members\nof the initial back four. The closest central midfielder then screened access\nback inside in a very organised, defence-first mentality.\n\n## 3\\. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp favoured a 4-3-3 during his time at Liverpool, coupled with high\npressing and aggressive counter-pressing through midfield. No team can\nconstantly press, though, so his Liverpool side often adopted a 4-1-4-1 shape\nto defend just inside the opposition half (below), rarely fully retreating\ninto a low block. Klopp\u2019s wide midfielders were still aggressive to jump out,\nwith the far-side wide midfielder narrowing significantly, but also moving\nhigher \u2013 better positioned to counter-attack after a regain. This also allowed\nthe central-midfield pair to cover less ground, taking the screening reliance\noff the single pivot between the lines.\n\n## 4\\. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s Real Madrid\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has used a variety of formations and strategies following his\nreturn to Madrid in 2021. In European competition especially, Madrid have\noften won games via clinical attacking moments from counter-attacks, or\nprolonged but solid defensive displays just inside their own half. Ancelotti\u2019s\n4-3-3 has morphed into a 4-1-4-1, using versatile midfielders such as Luka\nModric, Toni Kroos, Federico Valverde, Casemiro, Eduardo Camavinga, Aur\u00e9lien\nTchouam\u00e9ni and Jude Bellingham. Vin\u00edcius on the left \u2013 before his central role\n\u2013 had licence to stay higher from the 4-1-4-1 block, ready to counter, with\nthe rest of the midfield unit then adapting across (below).\n\n## What are the benefits of playing with a 4-1-4-1?\n\nWithout the ball, the 4-1-4-1 shape provides lots of central compactness and\nprotection, with numbers, balance and cover making it very difficult for the\nopposition to progress through the middle of the pitch. The 4-1-4-1 therefore\nprovides the foundation for a very effective low or mid-block. But if needed,\nteams can quickly and efficiently switch to higher pressing.\n\nThe single pivot protecting between the lines also helps cover a significant\nattacking space, which almost all teams try to exploit, one way or another.\nAnd with the wide midfielder and full-back pairing stopping wide overloads,\nnumbers are then ready for subsequent crosses and cut-backs.\n\nWhen starting with a 4-1-4-1, a team can shift in one movement to different\nshapes and structures, giving fluidity and versatility. The wide midfielders\ncan advance into winger roles to become a 4-3-3. One of the back line can\nadvance as a second pivot \u2013 now a common Premier League trend \u2013 to create a\n3-2-4-1. The central midfielders can also adapt to form a 4-2-3-1.\n\n## What are the disadvantages of playing with a 4-1-4-1?\n\nAs the 4-1-4-1 is very much a defensive structure, or a base from which to\ninstigate counter-attacks, the depth of the players can invite pressure as\nteams attempt to build upon a regain. As this occurs, teams must therefore be\nable to pass and receive, potentially under significant pressure.\n\nAlthough the main strength of this shape is the placement of the defensive\nmidfielder, that does remove a presence from elsewhere on the pitch. Those\nahead have an increased defensive responsibility to protect the spaces, with\none player fewer.\n\nThe wide midfielders must work back to help their full-back, defending deep.\nAs such, their own counter-attacking output can be severely reduced.\n\nThe single centre-forward can be isolated and easily overloaded when beginning\na counter-attack \u2013 especially off direct, forward passes. Therefore, teammates\nmust make early runs of support. The earlier teammates support with forward\nruns, however, the less defensive compactness will be available in the prior\nphase.\n\n_Learn more about football tactics and how to coach, from the very best \u2014 take\na look at CV Academy  here_\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### Birmingham City Under-16: Runs in behind \u2013 Midfield & defensive unit work\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Downloadable session plans\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Coaching Sessions\n\nMBP Coaches' School\n\n### Specialist in Set Pieces\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

Ahead of this back line is a significant\ncentral midfield presence, with three players operating as a flat trio.\n\nThe midfield is bolstered by the addition of two attacking midfielders, or\nnumber 10s. A single centre-forward then leads the line as the highest\nattacker.\n\n## Is a 4-3-2-1 the same as the \u2018Christmas tree formation\u2019?\n\nThe 4-3-2-1 formation is often referred to as the Christmas Tree formation,\ndue to the shape it represents when in a set shape or block.\n\n## Where does the 4-3-2-1 originate?\n\nThe 4-3-2-1 is thought to have derived from the 4-3-3 structure. Instead of\nhaving two wide players in the attacking line, as the 4-3-3 does, the\nsupporting attackers in a 4-3-2-1 are placed either side of the central\nforward in the number 10 positions.\n\nAccording to _Inverting The Pyramid_ author Jonathan Wilson, Dutch coach Co\nAdriaanse is thought to have have introduced this system to top-level\nfootball, at Den Haag in the late 1980s. Terry Venables then deployed a\n4-3-2-1 during his time as England manager. It was at this point, in 1994,\nthat the term \u2018Christmas tree formation\u2019 became widespread in British\nfootball.\n\n## What are the in-possession responsibilities of players in a 4-3-2-1?\n\nThe single central forward provides the main height in attack, occupying\nspaces between and around the opposing central defenders. This forward\u2019s job\nis to either hold the ball up and link with the supporting number 10s, or\nprovide movements in behind and create space for the 10s to exploit.\n\nThe number 10s can also make penetrative runs, rotating with the central\nforward, as well as operate in spaces between the lines. With the attack\ninitially providing minimal width, it\u2019s also common to see one of the 10s\nwidening (below) to receive and attack the full-backs.\n\nThe three central midfielders support the attack with forward runs. The two\nouter midfielders, however, have to work around the positioning and movements\nof the number 10s. If, for example, the number 10 ahead has remained narrow,\nthen the supporting central midfielder can hold and support underneath. If\nthey want to join the attack, alternatively, they can overlap into the wide\nspaces. The most central of the midfield trio will often drop towards the back\nline to support the build-up, especially with a possession-based style of play\n(above).\n\nShould none of the central midfielders move wide, then the full-backs can push\nforward, overlap and provide width in the attack. This would usually be\nthrough delayed support, however.\n\n## What are players\u2019 out-of-possession responsibilities in a 4-3-2-1?\n\nBecause the 4-3-2-1 shape is so narrow, it naturally covers, screens and\nprotects the central areas well. The centre-forward and number 10s can press\nthe opposing back line, or screen passes to the opposition\u2019s deeper central\nmidfielders. For the most part, because of the central numbers, the front line\nin this particular formation will press from in to out.\n\nWhen play is worked into the wide areas, the closest number 10 or central\nmidfielder will press out, often supported by their next midfield teammate.\nTheir teammates on the far side will then narrow, to provide cover and\nadditional defensive support. The central-midfield trio will also screen any\ncentral access into the opposing front line.\n\nThe back four will deal with the opposition\u2019s front line, with the full-backs\nsupported by central midfielders working back. When in a more reserved block,\nthe 4-3-2-1 shape naturally concedes wider spaces, sometimes allowing the\nopposition to initially progress up the pitch. However the 4-3-2-1 has lots of\nbodies and numbers defensively, ready to deal with crosses and passes from the\nwide areas.\n\n## Examples of teams using a 4-3-2-1\n\n## 1\\. Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s AC Milan\n\nCarlo Ancelotti \u2014 who won the 2003 and 2007 Champions Leagues as Milan head\ncoach \u2014 utilised a 4-3-2-1 shape during his spell at the San Siro. He based it\naround the influence of Andrea Pirlo as a central pivot in the midfield trio.\n\nPirlo was flanked by Gennaro Gattuso and Massimo Ambrosini, both of whom could\npress, duel and defend the central spaces when in a block, or jumping out to\npress. They also protected Pirlo\u2019s receiving, and joined the attack to support\nthe number 10s, Clarence Seedorf and Kak\u00e1. The latter was Milan\u2019s main\nattacking outlet, joining the central forward \u2014 variously Alberto Gilardino,\nFilippo Inzaghi or Ronaldo.\n\n## 2\\. Julian Nagelsmann\u2019s RB Leipzig\n\nDespite using a variety of structures, shapes and ideas at RB Leipzig, Julian\nNagelsmann would often look to place one or two number 10s between the lines,\nwith various rotations in the front line. When a midfield trio supported these\nattackers, a 4-3-2-1 shape would be the result. Here, the full-backs supported\nwith overlapping runs through the wide areas (below).\n\n## 3\\. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s Juventus\n\nIn his sole season with Juventus, Maurizio Sarri would often attack with a\n4-3-2-1, in which Cristiano Ronaldo played as the focal centre-forward. The\nlikes of Paulo Dybala, Federico Bernardeschi and Aaron Ramsey operated\nunderneath, in the 10 spaces. Miralem Pjanic was the single pivot, linking the\nback line to the number 10s.\n\nEnergetic and shuttling midfielders, such as Blaise Matuidi, Sami Khedira,\nRodrigo Bentancur and Adrien Rabiot, would support pressing into the wide\nareas. They also provided short-passing options to help work the ball into the\nnumber 10 spaces, or beyond for Ronaldo.\n\n## 4\\. Christophe Galtier\u2019s PSG\n\nDuring his spell with Paris Saint-Germain in the 2022/23 season, Christophe\nGaltier attempted to work Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Neymar and Lionel Messi into the same\nline up. When used, the 4-3-2-1 shape worked well, allowing Messi and Neymar\nto create from the number 10 positions in either inside channel, as well as\nthe central spaces. Mbapp\u00e9 provided pace and direct penetration as a constant\nthreat beyond.\n\nThe central-midfield trio often had Marco Verratti as the ball-playing pivot.\nHe sometimes dropped into the back line to allow the full-backs, Achraf Hakimi\nand Nuno Mendes, to overlap and create width around Messi and Neymar. The\nlikes of Vitinha, Danilo Pereira and Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz would also cover for these\nfull-back advances by widening, creating bigger pockets for Messi and Neymar\nin the process.\n\n## What are the benefits of playing a 4-3-2-1?\n\nThe 4-3-2-1 formation places lots of players in the central spaces, allowing\nfor overloads in this area of the pitch. This can help a team dominate the\nball and secure play through the centre, while providing cover and numbers for\ncentral counter-attacks, as well as recovery runs in defensive transition.\n\nThe two number 10s can be difficult for opponents to nullify, especially if\nthe centre-forward\u2019s positioning helps create space for them to receive in key\nareas. The midfield numbers also allow for multiple forward runs in behind and\nrotations in central areas. This can place frequent pressure on the opposing\nback line.\n\nIf a team has particularly attacking full-backs, plenty of space is also\navailable for them to push forward and create high up the pitch.\n\n## What are the disadvantages to playing a 4-3-2-1?\n\nThe 4-3-2-1 lacks natural width in attack, not least immediate width when\nregaining possession, ready for an attacking transition. It can be easy for\nthe opposition to gain ground and progress through the wide areas, in\ndefensive transition. Opposing teams can also find it straightforward to\ncreate overloads against the full-backs.\n\nIn order to fill the wider spaces when attacking, players in a 4-3-2-1 must\nrotate and move out of their primary role. This requires tactically and\ntechnically flexible players, plus a strong understanding of teammates\u2019 roles\nand movements.\n\nThe 4-3-2-1 often requires the two wider central midfielders to cover a lot of\nground. They must run into the wide areas in possession, but also jump out to\npress when out of it. This specific role requires a certain physical profile,\nin order for the structure to maintain its defensive strengths, alongside\nattacking flexibility.\n\n_Learn more about football tactics and how to coach, from the very best \u2013 take\na look at CV Academy  here_\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### Birmingham City Under-16: Runs in behind \u2013 Midfield & defensive unit work\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Downloadable session plans\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Coaching Sessions\n\nMBP Coaches' School\n\n### Specialist in Set Pieces\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

The most common\nset-up in midfield is one deeper player \u2013 the single pivot \u2013 and two slightly\nmore advanced to either side. The front line is then composed of two wide\nattackers who play on either side of a single centre-forward.\n\n**Where does the 4-3-3 originate from?**  \nIn response to the 1950 World Cup final defeat at home to Uruguay, Brazil\nstarted to use a back line of four in a 4-2-4 formation. They went on to use\nthis formation at the 1958 World Cup, which they won. By 1962, Brazil had\nadapted once more to create a 4-3-3 structure in which M\u00e1rio Zagallo dropped\nfrom the front line into midfield.\n\nAt the next World Cup, in England in 1966, the hosts and eventual winners used\na more permanent defensive midfielder \u2013 Nobby Stiles \u2013 in a 4-1-2-3 formation.\n\nAlthough the 4-3-3 was then used across Italy, Argentina and Uruguay for years\nto come, Rinus Michels\u2019 Netherlands and Ajax sides of the 1970s were two of\nthe most famous for inspiring the use of a 4-3-3 shape. It was these teams\u2019\ntactics that led to the concept of Total Football and encouraged the likes of\nJohan Cruyff to use a 4-3-3 when he became a coach, too.\n\n**What are the players' in-possession responsibilities in a 4-3-3?**  \nThe main responsibility for the wingers is isolating full-backs and attacking\nin one-on-one situations \u2013 either working around the outside of their\nopponents to cross, or cutting inside to combine. The latter approach is\ncommon for wrong-footed wingers or inside forwards, who aim to come off the\nflank and shoot at goal. Wingers holding a wide position can help create space\ninfield for an attacking midfielder to run into. A winger moving infield,\nmeanwhile, creates space on the outside for a full-back to overlap into.\n\nThe lone centre-forward moves across the pitch as the attack builds, pinning\nthe opposition\u2019s ball-side centre-back. The forward can drop short to link and\nhelp create overloads in central midfield, or provide direct runs beyond the\nopposition. These runs are often to try and get on the end of through balls,\nand in the process push the opposition\u2019s defence back into deeper territory.\nThis will, in turn, create space centrally for midfielders or wide forwards to\nmove into.\n\nThe midfield three provide passing options for both build-up and attacking\nplay. The two more attack-minded midfielders are often positioned in the\ninside channels and provide forward runs between the winger and centre-forward\nto get into crossing positions. If deeper, they connect the full-back and\ncentre-back on their side to the winger and centre-forward. The defensive\nmidfielder is the primary link between the back line and midfield, though, and\nthe main player through which switches of play are made to access the other\nside of the pitch.\n\nThe back line \u2013 especially the centre-backs \u2013 focus on accessing the central\nmidfield unit during build-up, especially if they have an overload in that\narea. The centre-backs will also often reposition themselves to allow the\ndeepest midfielder to drop into the back line during build-up. The full-backs\nthen push forward, providing the team\u2019s width as the wrong-footed wingers move\ninside. Then, the attacking midfielders may remain deeper, acting as cover\nshould the move break down.\n\n**What are the players' out-of-possession responsibilities in a 4-3-3?  \n** Having three players in attack means a 4-3-3 is a good shape to use to\npress high up the pitch. The wingers can start narrow to block the central\nareas before pressing outwards to force the ball wide, with the centre-forward\naiming to block off any switch of play. It is also possible for the wingers to\nstart wider and press inwards, should the aim be to force play into a midfield\ntrap. Another option is the wingers positioning themselves in line with the\ntwo outside central midfielders to form a 4-1-4-1 block.\n\nThe three central midfielders cover and protect central areas, and can quickly\nadapt to become two defensive midfielders and one advanced midfielder if\nnecessary. This can occur either when a block is formed or when pressing. When\nset in the more traditional 4-3-3 shape \u2013 with one defensive midfielder\nflanked by two others \u2013 the advanced midfielders can individually press the\nwide areas behind the wingers, or jump to support the centre-forward.\n\nThe back four will remain compact for as long as possible when defending in a\nset block, protected by the midfield three. Opponents can target spaces out\nwide, between the full-back and winger; here, the back line can move across\nthe pitch aggressively. The full-backs may jump forward to support a higher\npress, especially if the winger on the same side is committed forwards. The\nback line will again slide across the pitch to support the full-back.\n\n**Which are the best examples of teams using a 4-3-3?**\n\n**Pep Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona**  \nGuardiola has often used a 4-3-3 as his preferred starting shape. With\nBarcelona, the width was created by wingers such as Lionel Messi, Pedro,\nCristian Tello or Alexis S\u00e1nchez, or converted wide forwards in Thierry Henry\nand David Villa (above, top). Playing with high, wide players worked to pin\nback the opposition\u2019s back line. This created space in the inside channels for\nXavi, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta or Thiago to dominate possession, and feed play into the\nforwards. A dropping centre-forward \u2013 or false nine \u2013 in Samuel Eto\u2019o, Messi\nor Cesc F\u00e0bregas further overloaded areas in central midfield.\n\n**J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool**  \nIn Klopp\u2019s 4-3-3, wrong-footed wingers Mo Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 moved inside,\nallowing full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson to overlap and\nprovide crosses, cut-backs and the majority of the team\u2019s width (above).\nJordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum, playing just ahead of single pivot\nFabinho, provided support underneath the ball. Centre-forward Roberto Firmino\noffers forward runs to threaten in behind and combine high up the pitch, but\njust as commonly drops in to midfield to create overloads.\n\n**Maurizio Sarri\u2019s Napoli**  \nSarri\u2019s 4-3-3 used a blend of wingers and overlapping full-backs to provide\nthe team\u2019s width, often in an asymmetrical style and with different\ncombinations on each flank. On the left, right-footed winger Lorenzo Insigne\nwould cut inside, and left-back Faouzi Ghoulam overlapped. Marek Hams\u00edk made\nforward runs through the left inside channel as part of the rotations on that\nside. On the right, right-footed winger Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n held the width, with\nright-back Elseid Hysaj more often keeping his position in the back line \u2013\nespecially when Ghoulam pushed forward (below).\n\n**What are the benefits of playing with a 4-3-3?**  \nThe 4-3-3 creates natural triangles, often giving the player in possession\nseveral passing options at any given time. This makes implementing a\npossession-based style of play slightly easier than some other formations.\n\nThe three-player midfield unit can create overloads in central areas, which\nwill further help attempts to dominate possession. A dropping centre-forward\nor inverted full-back can add another body in midfield. This can help retain a\ncentral overload, should the opposition also set up with three central\nmidfielders.\n\nThe formation also makes it easy for lots of players to move forward and\nattack. Many teams playing in a 4-3-3 will end up with a front line of five,\nwith the centre-forward and wingers accompanied by the full-backs or attacking\nmidfielders.\n\nThe 4-3-3 is also a good formation from which to press. A three-man forward\nline provides good numbers to apply pressure on the opposition defence. The\nmidfield three then provides cover and protection in central areas. This is\nuseful both when pressing high or converting into a more reserved block.\n\n**What are the disadvantages to playing with a 4-3-3?**  \nThe space left in the wide areas between the full-back and winger in a 4-3-3\ncan be exposed and targeted by the opposition. This is usually via quick\ncounter-attacks and swift, direct switches of play.\n\nWith this formation encouraging players to push forward and join the attack,\nteams can leave themselves short of numbers when it comes to slowing or\nstopping opposing counter-attacks. Opponents can then progress further\nfollowing a transition, meaning bigger and more frequent recovery runs back\ninto shape. This increases the physical demands on the players.\n\nA lone centre-forward can be isolated in attack if they lack support from the\nwide attackers or advanced midfielders, and as such can find themselves\nnumerically underloaded against opposition centre-backs. This can also mean\ntoo little attacking presence in the penalty area if teammates fail to make\nsupporting runs.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?

Pep\nGuardiola has occasionally deployed it during his time at Manchester City,\nincluding during the treble-winning campaign. In that season, City found it\ntough to overcome Simone Inzaghi\u2019s Inter in the Champions League final, where\nthe Italian side lined up in a 3-5-2.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Roma reached the Europa League final in the same year with a\n3-5-2 formation. They had previously knocked out Xabi Alonso\u2019s Bayer\nLeverkusen, who have also used the system regularly.\n\nRudi Garcia used the 3-5-2 during his spell at Lyon, as he explained in his\nCoaches\u2019 Voice Masterclass (below). Even Diego Simeone has switched from his\nclassic 4-4-2 at Atletico Madrid in recent seasons, in favour of a 3-5-2.\n\nBut it was Antonio Conte who brought the 3-5-2 back into vogue during his\nsuccessful time at Juventus. He then deployed the formation during spells at\nInter, Chelsea and Tottenham.\n\nIt is a system that has broken with its old defensive stereotype, morphing\ninto more of an attacking set-up. Here, The Coaches\u2019 Voice highlights some of\nthe advantages of a 3-5-2, and the keys to executing it successfully.\n\n## Back three\n\nIn a 3-5-2 formation, the back three are generally three traditional centre-\nbacks (below). This back line is key to the in-possession and out-of-\npossession advantages that a 3-5-2 offers.\n\nIn possession, the back three usually provides an overload in the build-up,\nbecause it is difficult for the opposition to commit three players to press\nthe first line. If this happens, the goalkeeper can make it a 4v3.\n\nOut of possession, the three central defenders give protection centrally and\nagainst direct play. These defenders should shuffle across to help cover the\nflanks when necessary.\n\nThe movement of one centre-back to cover a wing-back is accompanied by\nmovement across to cover from the other two centre-backs. This cover gives the\ndefensive line confidence to make aggressive defensive moves, knowing they\nhave protection behind.\n\nThe presence of wing-backs also gives the 3-5-2 something of a defensive\ncharacter. The wing-backs can drop to help cover centre-backs, as well as\nreducing space for the opposition to exploit around the back line.\n\nIn this way, the system can become a pressing 4-4-2 block, protecting against\npossible counter-attacks from the opposition. This is achieved by filling\nspace in the most direct route to goal, as well as having a defensive\noverload.\n\n## Wing-backs\n\nThe role of the wing-backs in a 3-5-2 is important and is very much determined\nby how far forward they are positioned.\n\nHigher wing-backs can become almost like wingers, giving the 3-5-2 a more\nattacking character. This can cause the opposition to drop deep, creating\nspace on the sides of the opposing midfielders.\n\nIf the wing-backs stay deep, creating a line of five with the centre-backs, it\ncan give the opposition space to play in front (below).\n\nThere is a difference between an attacking 3-5-2, where the wing-backs play\nhigh, and a defensive 3-5-2 where the wing-backs sit deeper without taking the\ninitiative.\n\nIn the modern game, coaches using a 3-5-2 tend to do so with attacking,\nproactive wing-backs. This applies not only in-possession, but also when\ndefending, where the wing-backs must be first to press if the opposition build\non the outside. A wing-back must also be active in regaining their position\nwhen the ball is on the opposite side.\n\nThe 3-5-2 places high demands on the wing-backs, who tend to cover the longest\naverage distance per game (below). They must be fast, with the ability to\nprogress down the line and put in crosses. They also require good 1v1\ndefensive skills and the ability to defend their own area. Players these\nspecific characteristics are needed to occupy the entire flank effectively.\n\n## Numbers inside\n\nThe use of three central midfielders, along with wing-backs and two strikers,\ncan provide numbers between the lines. This creates plenty of passing options\nin a 3-5-2.\n\nIf these inside players provide movement, opposing defenders must decide\nwhether to track or stay in their zone. Any doubts can leave players free, or\ncreate spaces that can be exploited when attacking.\n\nIn the 3-5-2 formation, players must take up positions that attract markers\naway from the ball carrier. In turn, this should create time and space for the\nball receiver.\n\nOut of possession, having numbers on the inside allows midfielders and\ndefenders to defend the key central areas without having to cover too much\nground. When the ball is played wide, that is a trigger for inside players to\nsupport and cover the pressing wing-back.\n\n## Offensive versatility\n\nOne of the main benefits of the 3-5-2 formation is its attacking versatility\nand opportunities to develop link-up play. This is done typically via\noverloads in the first third, and support in the midfield and attacking lines.\nTeams can also move the ball quickly to the flanks with higher wing-backs.\n\nThere is also the possibility of more direct play, with two strikers ready to\ncontest the ball or attack spaces (below). The strikers should be supported by\nthe wing-backs and midfielders, who can receive lay-offs or contest second-\nphase balls.\n\n## Defensive organisation\n\nThe 3-5-2 offers defensive solidity if several requirements are met. While\nthree centre-backs can protect against counter-attacks, the positioning of one\nor two midfielders can boost this protection further. Having two lines\ncentrally positioned, ready for defensive transitions, minimises vulnerability\nto counter-attacks.\n\nThe involvement of the wing-backs on defensive transitions is also crucial.\nThey must quickly change mentality, with the wing-back closest to the ball\nprepared to press or cover. The other wing-back must drop back also (below).\n\nDirecting the press towards the flanks where possible is important,\ncapitalising on the opposition having little space inside. With two strikers\nand three midfielders, a funnel can be created that aims to force the\nopposition outside. Here, the wing-backs must be ready to initiate the press\nand steal possession.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?

Ahead, five players comprise the midfield unit, with three\ncentral midfielders and two wider midfielders. A lone centre-forward operates\nas the highest player in the structure.\n\n## Where does the 4-5-1 originate from?\n\nThe 4-5-1 is very similar to the 4-3-3 shape, with two main differences. The\nwingers \u2013 or wide midfielders \u2013 position themselves slightly deeper in a\n4-5-1, much closer to the central-midfield trio. This helps form a more\ndistinct midfield unit of five (below).\n\nIn addition, the central-midfield unit is also less staggered (above). The\ndeepest of the three is much higher than the single pivot in a 4-3-3 shape.\nThe pivot often lines up marginally underneath, or even in line with, the two\nnumber eights either side. This forms a much flatter second line of five,\nahead of the back four and underneath the single centre-forward.\n\nThe 4-5-1 is ultimately a defensive variation of the 4-3-3 shape. The first\nreal use of the 4-3-3 came when Brazil\u2019s 1958 World Cup winners converted\ntheir 4-2-4 system in possession. Coaches then began to adopt the 4-3-3 as a\npreferred attacking shape. This 4-3-3 evolved when defending, so that the\nwingers dropped to form a 4-1-4-1 out of possession. The 4-1-4-1 eventually\nfeatured a flatter line of five; the single pivot moved up to complete the\n4-5-1 shape.\n\n## What are the in-possession responsibilities of a 4-5-1?\n\nThe 4-5-1 predominantly features when a team is defending. In possession, it\nwill usually convert into a 4-1-4-1 (below) or a 4-3-3.\n\nIn the 4-5-1, the centre-forward\u2019s main job, in addition to scoring and\ncreating, is to hold and secure possession of the ball. This should allow\nteammates to link into forward runners, which would usually be the number\neights or wide midfielders pushing up the pitch on transition.\n\nThe number eights provide penetrative forward runs, often inside the wide\nmidfielders (above). They may also narrow to support in the number 10 spaces,\nor as a second centre-forward during transitions.\n\nA number eight may also move deeper, towards the ball, to create a temporary\ndouble pivot ahead of the back line (below). The central-midfield trio is\nresponsible for maintaining possession, often via short passes, upon a regain\nor when a counter-attack isn\u2019t immediately available. Retaining the ball\nallows the 4-5-1 to expand into other shapes and structures.\n\nThe wide midfielders are often the main counter-attacking outlet, making runs\nin behind or dribbling with the ball to get their team up the pitch. They will\nprovide crosses for the central forward and midfield runners. Wrong-footed\nwide players, by contrast, may cut inside more, to work shots on goal.\n\nThe full-backs can provide secondary support in wide areas during transitional\nmoments, especially if the wide midfielder ahead drives inside with the ball,\nor narrows without it. The full-backs should also assist the midfield by\nproviding a short-passing option. Full-backs can do this by moving inside,\nwhich can push one of the number eights higher.\n\nThe centre-backs provide forward passes into the midfield unit, or more direct\npasses into wide areas for the wide midfielders. They can also drive into\nmidfield via the inside channels, especially if the number eights have run\nforward.\n\n## What are the out-of-possession responsibilities of a 4-5-1?\n\nThe centre-forward should press opposing centre-backs to force the ball one\nway. This will be most commonly outwards, locking it to the touchline (below).\nAlternatively, the forward can drop deeper and screen access into the\nopposition pivot. This allows the central midfielders to form more of a zonal\ndefensive screen, blocking the centre.\n\nThe central-midfield trio can apply player-oriented marking or the\naforementioned zonal cover. The number eights can also support the forward\u2019s\npress, locking the ball one way (below).\n\nThe wide midfielders can take up wider defensive positions due to the presence\nof the three central midfielders, who often defend as a flat trio. These wide\nplayers can help support ahead of the full-backs, and track opposing forward\nruns wide. Along with the full-backs, they force the ball outwards, using the\ntouchline as an extra defender. Wide midfielders also help full-backs to block\ncrosses and cut-backs when play has been locked on one side.\n\nThe centre-backs have ample cover and protection ahead due to the presence of\nthe central-midfield trio, and can therefore focus more on the spaces behind.\nHowever, they may have to individually jump forward to deal with balls into an\nopposing central forward\u2019s feet.\n\nThe back four maintain compactness in a more reserved block, shifting across\nas the ball is locked. They should be ready to drop back or squeeze up, in\nrelation to the movement of the ball and opposing runners.\n\n## Examples of teams using a 4-5-1\n\n## 1. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s compact block at **Liverpool**\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool are associated with incisive attacking and aggressive\ncounter-pressing, but he has often used a 4-5-1 when a more compact block is\nrequired.\n\nIn this shape, Liverpool\u2019s number eights have still had licence to jump out,\nwhile the wingers \u2013 especially Mo Salah \u2013 have been key outlets on attacking\ntransitions. As the 4-5-1 expands, and the wingers advance, space has been\ncreated for Trent Alexander-Arnold to move inside from right-back. Below is an\nexample of a 4-5-1 from Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, during their cup double-winning\n2021/22 season.\n\n## 2\\. Eddie Howe\u2019s Newcastle United mid-block\n\nEddie Howe helped to transform Newcastle with an impressive 4-5-1 mid-block.\nIn this shape, Howe\u2019s wide midfielders have worked back to stop full-backs\nKieran Trippier and Dan Burn being overloaded. On Burn\u2019s side especially,\nsupport from the winger has prevented a player perhaps more obviously seen as\na centre-back being exposed in 1v1 moments against fast wingers (below).\n\nHowe\u2019s 4-5-1 has also jumped high to press, with the wingers working up the\npitch to press high. Meanwhile, the likes of Joelinton, Bruno Guimar\u00e3es, Sean\nLongstaff and Joe Willock have frequently pressed across the pitch to support\nwide regains.\n\n## 3\\. Napoli 2019-2021 with Gennaro Gattuso\n\nUnder Gennaro Gattuso, Napoli won the 2020 Coppa Italia using a disciplined\n4-5-1 mid-block, which they also deployed in the Champions League and Serie A.\nThe forward \u2013 usually Dries Mertens or Arkadiusz Milik \u2013 would drop to\nreceive, while wide midfielders Lorenzo Insigne and Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n progressed\nforward with the ball. Here, the front three was particularly fluid.\n\nOut of possession, Napoli\u2019s strength was their defensive flexibility. One of\nthe central midfielders could support around Mertens or Milik to instigate a\nhigher press (below). The central midfield would then readjust and push\nacross, in cover. As such, Napoli adapted their block according to opposition\nthreats, while remaining compact in the central spaces.\n\n## 4\\. England under Gareth Southgate\n\nAfter Euro 2020, Gareth Southgate gradually moved away from back-three\nsystems, working towards a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 shape. But the England head coach\nstill favoured a mid-block without the ball, utilising either a 4-1-4-1 or a\nflatter 4-5-1 shape.\n\nIn this shape, Declan Rice as the pivot often jumped forward, enabling the\nnumber eights to push up around Harry Kane. From here, Kane could force the\nball wide and the closest winger jumped forward.\n\nIf a winger narrowed, Rice, Jordan Henderson, Kalvin Phillips and Jude\nBellingham all had the defensive versatility and energy to cover the central\nspaces. As a result, the winger on the far side could instead track opposing\nforward runs.\n\n## What are the benefits of playing with a 4-5-1?\n\nThe 4-5-1 provides central compactness, with numbers, balance and cover. This\nmaked it difficult for the opposition to progress through the middle of the\npitch. It makes for a very effective low or mid-block, but can quickly and\nefficiently create higher pressing.\n\nWith the central-midfield trio\u2019s compactness, wingers can track opposing full-\nback runs and stop overloads in the wide areas. Numbers in the central spaces\ncan deal with subsequent crosses and cut-backs.\n\nWhen starting in a 4-5-1, a single quick movement can lead to a different\nshape, allowing for fluidity and versatility. For example, one of the number\neights can move higher to form a 4-4-2, or the deepest central midfielder can\ndrop into a single pivot position, creating a 4-3-3. A double pivot can also\nform in a 4-2-3-1.\n\n## What are the disadvantages of playing with a 4-5-1?\n\nThe 4-5-1 is predominantly a defensive structure, or a base from which to\ninstigate counter-attacking moments. Due to the flatness of the midfield unit,\nit can be harder to dominate the ball. When trying to play across the pitch,\nor switch the play with shorter passes, the midfield has to reorganise, often\nstaggering into different lines. As this occurs, teams must be able to pass\nand receive, potentially under pressure.\n\nWingers\u2019 counter-attacking output can be reduced, due to working back to help\nfull-backs. The single central forward, meanwhile, can be isolated and easily\noverloaded when trying to begin a counter-attack. This is especially the case\nwith direct, forward passes. Early support runs are therefore needed, but this\ncan lead to less defensive compactness.\n\n_Learn more about football tactics and how to coach, from the very best \u2013 take\na look at CV Academy  here_\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### Birmingham City Under-16: Runs in behind \u2013 Midfield & defensive unit work\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Downloadable session plans\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Coaching Sessions\n\nMBP Coaches' School\n\n### Specialist in Set Pieces\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

The midfield unit creates a\ndiamond, with a single pivot at the base, two number eights on the outside of\nthe midfield four, and a number 10 at the tip of the diamond, playing\nunderneath a front line of two centre-forwards (below).\n\nJuventus played a midfield diamond under Max Allegri\n\n## Where does the 4-4-2 diamond originate?\n\nThe 4-4-2 diamond emerged when the centre-forward in a 4-3-3 shape dropped\ntowards the midfield line of three. In 1962, Brazil formed a 4-3-3 structure,\nwith M\u00e1rio Zagallo dropping out of the front line to create an overload in\nmidfield. Despite being a centre-forward in the starting line-up, Zagallo took\nup positions similar to the number 10 in a 4-4-2 diamond.\n\nAt the next World Cup, in England in 1966, the hosts and eventual winners\nlined up with a permanent defensive midfielder \u2013 Nobby Stiles \u2013 in a 4-1-2-3\nformation. Over time, the two tactical ideas would merge to form the 4-4-2\ndiamond.\n\nWith the 4-3-3 increasing in popularity through the 1970s, teams could easily\nconvert into a 4-4-2 diamond through the centre-forward dropping like a false\nnine. The two wingers would either come inside to threaten goal or stay wide\nas split strikers.\n\n## What are the in-possession responsibilities of players in a 4-4-2 diamond?\n\nThe two centre-forwards provide height in attack by occupying the opposing\ncentre-backs. They can try to hold the ball up to bring the number 10 or\nadvancing number eights into play, or they can threaten the space in behind\nthe opposition. They can also move into wide positions to receive long passes\nin space, with that kind of movement creating space centrally for midfield\nrunners. This movement creates positioning now known as \u2018split strikers\u2019\n(below).\n\nManchester United's strikers, Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford, split to\ncreate space for number 10 Jesse Lingard to make a run through\n\nThe number 10 is the main link between the midfield and the attack, and often\ntakes up positions between the lines \u2013 specifically aiming to threaten an area\nknown as Zone 14 (below). The number 10 can provide runs beyond the\nopposition\u2019s back line when one or both centre-forwards move wide, but their\nmain responsibility tends to be creating chances.\n\nThe two number eights mostly work through the inside channels, and will\nusually play as box-to-box midfielders. They may provide the team\u2019s width when\nthe full-backs are too deep to push forward and join the attack.\n\nThe single pivot helps the team build out from the back, providing the link\nbetween defence and the rest of midfield. They may drop into the back line,\nbetween or to the side of the centre-backs, to allow the full-backs to push\ninto the second line. It\u2019s rare that the single pivot would move ahead of the\nball, instead acting as the point through which the team can recycle play or\nswitch the ball to the other side of the diamond or to the opposite flank.\n\nBecause there is no obvious or permanent wide player in the midfield or\nattacking units, the full-backs tend to provide the team\u2019s attacking width in\na 4-4-2 diamond. However, if the centre-forwards move wide and the number\neights push forward, the full-backs may invert and move into the space the\nnumber eight on their side has vacated. This ensures that the diamond is\nmaintained following a rotation.\n\n## What are the out-of-possession responsibilities of players in a 4-4-2\ndiamond?\n\nAs central midfield tends to be crowded by the midfield four, the two centre-\nforwards will usually aim to force the opposition inwards. They will press\nfrom out to in, setting the wheels in motion for a central pressing trap.\n\nThe number 10 will either man-mark the opposition pivot or screen passes into\nthem, completing the first part of the central trap. If the centre-forwards\npress into wider positions, then the number 10 will jump out to press the\ncentre-backs.\n\nThe two number eights will mark players or zonally protect the inside\nchannels, aiming to prevent passes back inside from out wide. If the opponents\nevade the centre-forwards, then the number eights are free to jump out to\npress the full-backs, in the hope of stopping them from progressing too high\nup the pitch.\n\nThe single pivot will usually remain in front of the centre-backs and screen\npasses into the opposition strikers. They might jump forward if the rest of\nthe midfield move out to press, but will generally stick to a central\nposition.\n\n## Which teams and coaches have used a 4-4-2 diamond effectively?\n\n## Juventus under Massimiliano Allegri\n\nAfter taking over from Antonio Conte in 2014, Allegri converted Juventus from\na 3-5-2 into a 4-4-2 diamond in his first season in charge. Andrea Pirlo\nplayed at the base of midfield, with Claudio Marchisio and Paul Pogba as\nroaming number eights, and Arturo Vidal or Roberto Pereyra as the number 10.\nUp front, Carlos Tevez was paired with \u00c1lvaro Morata or Fernando Llorente, and\nthe team\u2019s width was provided by full-backs Patrice Evra and Stephan\nLichtsteiner. Although it looked like a major shift from Conte\u2019s 3-5-2,\nAllegri\u2019s diamond was only different in the addition of the number 10 at the\ntop of the central midfield unit in place of a third centre-back. The\ntransition to that shape was smooth, with Juventus retaining their Serie A\ntitle and making it to the Champions League final in their first season under\nAllegri.\n\n## Brighton under Graham Potter\n\nPotter used a variety of structures and formations throughout his time at\nBrighton, and he used a diamond midfield to create overloads in central areas.\nThis shape also enabled his two centre-forwards \u2013 usually Neal Maupay and\nDanny Welbeck \u2013 to split and take up wide positions (below), taking the\nopposition centre-backs into the channels and creating space for midfield\nrunners. Attack-minded full-backs such as Marc Cucurella, Tariq Lamptey and\nJo\u00ebl Veltman also made runs into the space the forwards created.\n\n## Liverpool under J\u00fcrgen Klopp\n\nKlopp has used a 4-3-3 shape throughout his Liverpool tenure, but centre-\nforward Roberto Firmino has been extremely effective dropping into midfield to\nadd a fourth player here. Wide forwards such as Mo Salah and Sadio Man\u00e9 move\ninside to become central threats on goal. The width in attack is then provided\nby full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson, with the team taking\nup a 4-4-2 diamond shape through their rotations. After the arrival of Darwin\nN\u00fa\u00f1ez, however, Klopp has used a more set 4-4-2 diamond in some games, with\nFirmino as a number 10 and N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Salah a centre-forward pair free to move\nwide when needed (below).\n\n## What are the benefits of playing with a 4-4-2 diamond?\n\nThe main strength of the 4-4-2 diamond is the overload it creates in central\nmidfield against any opponent with either two or three central midfielders,\nwhich includes all of football\u2019s most popular formations. This helps the team\ndominate possession and create attacks in dangerous areas through the centre\nof the pitch, while also providing cover against counter-attacks and central\nnumbers to counter-press in defensive transition.\n\nThe presence of two centre-forwards means both opposing centre-backs are\nconstantly occupied. Direct balls forward are thus more likely to be secured\nand held up, which gives the team a strong base from which to build counter-\nattacks.\n\nIf a team has particularly attacking full-backs, the midfield diamond leaves\nplenty of space for them to push forward and get into positions to create high\nup the pitch.\n\n## What are the disadvantages to playing with a 4-4-2 diamond?\n\nThe 4-4-2 diamond lacks natural width in attack, so it\u2019s often easy for the\nopposition to gain ground through the wide areas on transition. It can also be\neasy for the opposition to create numerical overloads against the full-backs\non the team playing with a diamond midfield.\n\nIn order to occupy wide spaces when attacking, players have to move out of\ntheir primary position. This not only requires intelligent players who are\nboth tactically and technically versatile, but also players with very high\nstamina levels.\n\nWith the diamond covering the centre of the pitch, midfielders can sometimes\nblock off their teammates\u2019 passing options into the centre-forwards.\nTherefore, access into the front two can sometimes be restricted to direct,\npredictable long balls, or balls into the channels for the strikers to chase.\n\n_To learn more from the professional coaches  of The Coaches\u2019 Voice, visit CV\nAcademy_\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### Birmingham City Under-16: Runs in behind \u2013 Midfield & defensive unit work\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Downloadable session plans\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Coaching Sessions\n\nMBP Coaches' School\n\n### Specialist in Set Pieces\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

In defence, there is a back\nfour consisting of two central defenders and two full-backs. Two deeper\ncentral midfielders operate ahead of the back line and are often referred to\nas a double pivot. Further forward, an attacking midfield three play behind a\nlone centre-forward.\n\n## Where does the 4-2-3-1 originate?\n\nWith many teams using a withdrawn centre-forward in a 4-4-2 in the late 1990s,\nthe 4-2-3-1 was eventually introduced in the 2000s to prevent access into\ncentral spaces between the lines. This initially stemmed from having a single\npivot covering these spaces \u2013 Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9 was the most notable of these \u2013\nbefore a second defensive midfielder was added ahead of the back line.\n\nThis formation became more popular as pressing became a bigger part of the\nmodern game. The double pivot covers the space in front of the back four but\nalso supports the press behind the centre-forward and attacking midfield\nthree. Manchester City assistant manager Juanma Lillo is thought to have\ninstigated the change from 4-4-2 to 4-2-3-1 in Spanish football, with the high\npress a significant contributing factor.\n\n## What are the in-possession responsibilities of players in a 4-2-3-1?\n\nThe single centre-forward is supported by the number 10 to provide the team\u2019s\nmain central attacking threat. It's also common for the wide attacking\nmidfielders to cut inside, often playing on their unnatural flank \u2013 as \u2018wrong-\nfooted\u2019 players \u2013 to provide a more direct threat on goal. The nine and and 10\nwill also rotate and swap positions to drag defenders out of shape and create\nspace in central areas for the wide players to run in behind.\n\nThe two players in the double pivot support underneath the ball, and are free\nto drift wide to help the team switch play. During transitions, one of the\ndouble pivot can push forward to provide extra threat on the counter-attack.\nFor the most part, though, they remain central and connected to the centre-\nbacks. These two players provide the link between the back four and the\nattacking unit of four.\n\nWith many wide midfielders working infield, the full-backs can overlap to\nprovide width in the attack (above). From here, they can deliver crosses and\ncut-backs from out wide, and provide an option for a switch of play. The\ndouble pivot gives security behind the ball, allowing both full-backs to push\nforward simultaneously.\n\nThe centre-backs will bring the ball out of defence, passing into midfield or\nplaying direct balls into the attackers. They will rarely dribble into\nmidfield, as there is already a double pivot ahead of them.\n\n## What are the out-of-possession responsibilities of the players in a\n4-2-3-1?\n\nThe back line of four will defend as a compact unit. The full-backs tuck in,\nand will defend against wide players in one-on-one situations. The central\ndefenders will mark the opposition\u2019s strikers. The double pivot provides\nprotection ahead of the centre-backs, covering the spaces between the lines.\n\nThe double pivot also supports behind a higher press, working from side to\nside to cover the gaps between the three attacking midfielders. One may jump\nforward to press alongside the number 10 or a wide midfielder, as well as\nmoving across to support a full-back.\n\nThe attacking midfield three and centre-forward will narrow, screening the\ncentral spaces when in a mid or low block. The centre-forward will often\ninstigate a high press, with the number 10 pushing forward to press alongside\nthem as a flat two, or covering beneath and marking the opposition\u2019s pivot. An\nin-possession 4-2-3-1 can therefore become an out-of-possession 4-4-2 or\n4-4-1-1. In any of these shapes, the far-side wide midfielder will move narrow\nto add a body in the centre of the pitch. This can be in a mid-block, low\nblock or when pressing high.\n\n## Which coaches and team have used a 4-2-3-1?\n\n## Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur\n\nIn Pochettino\u2019s 4-2-3-1, Harry Kane was supported by Dele Alli as a\npenetrative number 10 who often ran beyond the centre-forward. Son Heung-min\nalso provided penetrative movements, but did so more often following\ntransitions. Christian Eriksen played as a central number 10 or sometimes as\none of the wide attacking midfielders, although he would move central to help\nthe double pivot break through the opposition midfield. Kyle Walker and Danny\nRose provided attacking threat from the full-back positions, overlapping to\ngive the team width in attack (below). Meanwhile, a versatile double pivot of\nEric Dier and Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 provided protection in front of the two centre-\nbacks, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen.\n\n## Hansi Flick at Bayern Munich\n\nFlick\u2019s 4-2-3-1 (below) was particularly effective in Bayern's successful\n2019/20 Champions League campaign. They beat Chelsea 7-1 on aggregate and\nBarcelona 8-2, having also won 7-2 at Tottenham in the group stage. Centre-\nforward Robert Lewandowski had support from the mobile Thomas M\u00fcller, who ran\nbeyond the striker, provided extra presence in the box to attack crosses, and\nrotated with wide players Kingsley Coman, Ivan Perisic and Serge Gnabry, who\nmoved infield towards goal. Thiago controlled the tempo of the team\u2019s passing\nfrom his position between the back four and attacking midfield. He was paired\neither with Leon Goretzka, who provided penetrative runs around M\u00fcller, or\nJoshua Kimmich, who added a stronger defensive presence in the double pivot.\nThis allowed both full-backs, Benjamin Pavard and Alphonso Davies, to attack\nsimultaneously.\n\n## Pep Guardiola at Manchester City\n\nIn the 2020/21 season, Guardiola used a 4-2-3-1 more often than in any of his\nprior seasons at Manchester City. A double pivot of Rodri and either Ilkay\nG\u00fcndogan or Fernandinho covered the space ahead of the back four (below). The\nback line often converted into a three, as Jo\u00e3o Cancelo moved forward from\nleft-back. City often attacked without a traditional centre-forward; if\nGuardiola went without Gabriel Jesus or Sergio Ag\u00fcero, he would instead use a\nmidfielder or winger \u2013 Raheem Sterling, Riyad Mahrez, Phil Foden, Bernardo\nSilva or Ferran Torres \u2013 as a false nine. Central rotations allowed G\u00fcndogan\nto push forward from the double pivot \u2013 often with Cancelo joining Rodri in\nmidfield to maintain a two. G\u00fcndogan then made penetrative runs through the\ninside channels in the space created by the high and wide wingers.\n\n## Gareth Southgate with England\n\nSouthgate has almost always favoured a double pivot with England. He has used\na 4-2-3-1 both at Euro 2020 (below) and during the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.\nKalvin Phillips and Declan Rice made up the double pivot whenever they were\navailable. Both demonstrated exceptional ability to link the back line to the\nattacking midfield three and centre-forward Harry Kane, who often dropped into\nmidfield. England\u2019s attacking midfield three rotate constantly, making\npenetrative runs in behind as well as dropping into similar positions to Kane.\nMason Mount, Jack Grealish, Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden all offer impressive\nability to combine in tight spaces. Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling make\nmore penetrative runs beyond the opposition back line.\n\n## What are the benefits of playing with a 4-2-3-1?\n\nThe 4-2-3-1 provides a central midfield three that can overload a midfield\ntwo. The number 10 provides a presence between the lines, and can receive in\nspace when up against a flat midfield.\n\nThe double pivot provides a solid midfield base, allowing wide rotations and\ncover if one or both full-backs push forward. They also protect the central\nspaces when defending, and give an added later of security at defensive\ntransitions.\n\nThe 4-2-3-1 provides a good, staggered defensive presence when in a mid or low\nblock, making it harder to penetrate through, especially in central areas. A\n4-2-3-1 shape also provides lots of different passing lines and angles to play\nout from the back. The formation lends itself to triangles, making it\nconducive to a possession-based game.\n\n## What are the disadvantages to playing with a 4-2-3-1?\n\nThe single centre-forward can be isolated. They are always underloaded against\nopposing centre-backs, and the use of a double pivot means it can take longer\nfor others to push forward and support attacks.\n\nThe central midfield three can be overloaded by a four \u2013 a 4-4-2 diamond, for\nexample. If the number 10 stays too high when defending, an opposing midfield\nthree can overload the double pivot.\n\nThe wide areas can be vulnerable to switches of play during counter-attacks if\nboth full-backs have pushed forward. One of the double pivot can cover\nunderneath an advanced full-back on one side; as they move across and the\nother member of the double pivot is left alone, however, a switch of play can\nbypass both of them.\n\n_To learn more about football tactics and gain insights from coaches at the\ntop of the game, visit  CV Academy._\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### Birmingham City Under-16: Runs in behind \u2013 Midfield & defensive unit work\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Downloadable session plans\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Coaching Sessions\n\nMBP Coaches' School\n\n### Specialist in Set Pieces\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

The front line of two is formed by two centre-forwards who,\nin attack, provide both height and goalscoring threat.\n\n## **Where does the 4-4-2 originate?**\n\nMidway through the 20th century, the 4-2-4 formation emerged. This new shape\nfeatured two high and wide wingers who attacked alongside, and sometimes even\nahead of, the front two. The Brazilian national team won their first World Cup\nin 1958 playing this formation. Twelve years later, a team then coached by\nM\u00e1rio Zagallo \u2013 a member of the 1958 side \u2013 played a variation of the 4-2-4\nwhen captivating the world to win the 1970 tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian coach Viktor Maslov had developed another variation in\nwhich the two wingers dropped back alongside the two central midfielders. So\noriginated the 4-4-2, which worked to overload opposition midfields with\ntraditionally fewer numbers. Maslov is also credited with the development of\nmore organised, disciplined team pressing; with this approach, he led Dynamo\nKyiv to three consecutive league titles in the late 1960s.\n\n## **What are the in-possession responsibilities of a 4-4-2?**\n\nIn the 4-4-2 formation, the two centre-forwards provide height in the attack\nby occupying opposing centre-backs. They can hold the ball up before linking\nthe play into runners, or drift or drop away from the opposing back line to\ncreate space for a penetrative runner from midfield. Ultimately, they create\nand finish chances in front of goal.\n\nThe two wide players in the midfield unit attack around the opposition back\nline (below) to provide crosses for the two centre-forwards, or cut inside and\ncombine with shorter passes. They can also run inside and beyond as one of the\ntwo front players rotates out.\n\nThe two central midfielders connect the back line to the forwards through an\naccurate range of passing, and can operate deep or as box-to-box runners. They\nmay also provide narrow crosses when supporting underneath the wide\nmidfielders.\n\nThe full-backs also provide delayed support underneath the wide midfielders,\nand may move inside to help the midfielders during deeper build-up. If the\nwide midfielder ahead of them moves inside, the full-backs can overlap to\nprovide crosses and cut-backs.\n\nThe two centre-backs provide forward passes into midfield, and may also drive\ninto midfield through the inside channels. They can also switch play to the\nwide midfielder on the far side, or play more direct central passes into the\nfront line.\n\n## **What are the out-of-possession responsibilities of a 4-4-2?**\n\nThe two centre-forwards screen access in front of the opposition pivot or\npivots, and press on to the back line. This is usually against the centre-\nbacks, where the forwards will press outwards to force the play away from the\ncentre.\n\nAs the wide midfielders drop alongside the two central midfielders to form a\nflat four, this unit aims to maintain a compact distance between the front\nline and the back four (below). They move across when the ball is in wide\nareas, with the far-side wide midfielder covering central spaces. The central\nmidfielders often press their direct opponent man for man, with the wide\nmidfielders jumping to mark opposing full-backs.\n\nThe back line operates with similar levels of compactness, also narrowing\ninside when appropriate. The centre-backs are usually responsible for\nattackers who drop and attempt to receive between the lines, as well as\ncompeting against more direct central play and clearing crosses. The full-\nbacks will jump forward to press in the wide areas and look to block attacking\ncrosses. Any member of a back four should be prepared to drop and cover the\nspaces in behind.\n\n## **Which coaches and teams have used a 4-4-2 well?**\n\n## **Sir Alex Ferguson, Manchester United**\n\nFerguson favoured a 4-4-2 with wide midfielders who could attack around a\ndefensive line and cross, but also drift into the inside channels to combine\nwith box-to-box midfielders supporting the attack. The two forwards would\noften drift and rotate to look more like a number nine and 10, while the full-\nbacks would also push forward \u2013 but mostly through delayed overlapping runs,\nand only once the midfield was set in cover. Defensively, they would press\nopponents using the same 4-4-2, but they were also happy to sit off in a mid-\nblock on occasion. This invited teams forward, and left them open to the swift\ncounter-attacks Ferguson expected from the fluid front fours he employed\nthroughout his long and trophy-laden Old Trafford reign.\n\n## **Diego Simeone, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid**\n\nSimeone has favoured a 4-4-2 throughout his tenure at Atl\u00e9tico Madrid.\nDefensively, he prefers a mid or low block, focusing on compactness between\nhis units (below) and controlling matches through covering key spaces in\nAtl\u00e9tico\u2019s own half. In attack, the wide players have tended to move inside to\nsupport the forward pairing, with the full-backs overlapping. The central\nmidfielders then cover the wide areas if they need to \u2013 but Simeone always\nprioritises numbers in central spaces.\n\n## **Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, Southampton**\n\nDefensively, Hasenh\u00fcttl prefers his Southampton side to push up the pitch and\npress aggressively in their 4-4-2 shape. The two centre-forwards work on to\nthe back line, curving their press outwards. This is often supported by the\nclosest wide midfielder jumping forward (below), while the rest of the\nmidfield unit moves across to cover the centre. In attack, Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s 4-4-2\noperates similarly to that of Simeone, with lots of central numbers \u2013\nespecially after a high or midfield regain of possession.\n\n## **Sean Dyche, Burnley**\n\nDyche has utilised a 4-4-2 formation to defend in mid and low blocks\nthroughout his time in the Premier League, with versatile defenders able to\ncover a variety of spaces in their half \u2013 an approach he shares with Simeone.\nDyche\u2019s teams encourage the opposition forward, before aggressively pressing\nand duelling as the opponents attempt to play through the block. In attack,\nthe forwards often remain high, while the wide midfielders hold their width to\nprovide crosses and cut-backs (below). The full-backs offer support forward,\nbut rarely get as high as their Southampton or Atl\u00e9tico equivalents. The\nprofile of centre-forward Dyche likes is also different to that of Simeone and\nHasenh\u00fcttl. He prefers aerially strong attackers with a combative, physical\npresence \u2013 such as Chris Wood, Ashley Barnes and Wout Weghorst \u2013 to disrupt\nopposing centre-backs.\n\n## **What are the benefits of playing with a 4-4-2?**\n\nThe 4-4-2 places two central-forward threats high; up against a back four,\nthis means both opposing centre-backs are constantly occupied. The double\nthreat is also useful for securing central balls in advanced areas and\nsubsequent combinations in and around them. It also creates a forward base\nupon which teams can build effective counter-attacks.\n\nIn this particular formation, it is rare to see the full-backs defending\nunderloaded. Deeper wide midfielders are better positioned to recover and work\nback \u2013 compared with wide attackers in a 4-3-3, for example. The 4-4-2 offers\na strong defensive presence across the entire pitch, with compactness, balance\nand cover easy to establish in a high press, mid-block or low block.\n\nFinally, it also provides the perfect balance for counter-attacking football.\nTeams set up in a 4-4-2 have the numbers to defend in a compact, deep block to\nlure the opposition forward \u2013 but enough of a central presence to initiate\ncounters and link into a variety of forward runners.\n\n## **What are the disadvantages to playing with a 4-4-2?**\n\nTeams setting up in a 4-4-2 can face overloads in central midfield,\nparticularly against opposition fielding a midfield three. This can lead to a\nsignificant lack of possession.\n\nThere can also be a lack of defensive staggering in the 4-4-2, with players on\nthe same line within individual units. Despite the compactness this formation\noffers, it is susceptible to line-breaking passes \u2013 one good pass can take out\nfour players at once. A defensive formation such as the 4-1-4-1 offers greater\ncover between the lines.\n\nIn possession, with the midfield line of four set up similarly to the back\nline behind it, players can sometimes block off the team\u2019s forward passing\noptions. It is arguably more difficult for teams set up as such to create as\nmany passing options as teams with more players playing on different\nhorizontal and vertical lines.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?

Two wing-backs provide attacking width,\nwhile a front line of three can line up in several different ways.\n\nIt is increasingly common to see a narrow front three, with two number 10s\nsupporting a single centre-forward. This formation is also sometimes referred\nto as a 3-4-2-1. Alternatively, a flat front three features two inside\nforwards or wingers playing high and wide, positioned on the same line as the\ncentre-forward. Another option is for the wide players to attack centrally\nwhile the striker plays as a false nine. Here, the forward drops into midfield\nto try and drag the opposing centre-backs out of position.\n\n**Where does the 3-4-3 originate?**  \nThe W-M formation, first used in the early part of the 20th century, is the\nfirst example of a back three being used consistently (more on the W-M\nformation here). After the W-M, formations evolved to use a back four, and\nthen eventually back lines of five.\n\nThe 3-4-3 is thought to have first been used in Italy, where three central\ndefenders in a 3-5-2 was common. The 3-4-3 subsequently became a more\noffensive version of that shape. Johan Cruyff set his Barcelona team up in a\n4-3-3 shape, but often converted this into a 3-4-3 through a centre-back\nstepping forward into what then became a midfield diamond.\n\n**What are the players\u2019 in-possession responsibilities in a 3-4-3?  \n** The front line of three is responsible for creating and finishing chances,\nparticularly when the team is set up with two number 10s close to a single\ncentre-forward. In a front three featuring two wider forwards, there may be a\ngreater emphasis on counter-attacks and creating situations in which the wide\nattackers are isolated against the opposition full-backs.\n\nThe wing-backs have to be agile and fit, because they have to provide the\nteam\u2019s attacking width \u2013 often getting forward in an attacking line of five \u2013\nas well as working back to defend in a five. If they are playing behind a\nnarrow front three, they need to make overlapping runs around the wide number\n10 on their side of the pitch, and provide crosses and cut-backs from advanced\npositions. If they have a wide forward or winger ahead of them, they need to\nsupport underneath that player. They will also often make delayed underlapping\nruns to support the centre-forward and take defenders away from the wide\nplayer.\n\nThe double pivot are key to progressing play through the thirds, connecting\nthe back three with the wing-backs and front three. They are also important in\nswitching play between the wing-backs, and in feeding penetrative passes into\nthe front three. During counter-attacks, the central-midfield pair will often\nlook to find a wide forward running in behind.\n\nThe three centre-backs build play from the back, drive into midfield and play\npasses into the attackers. The two wider centre-backs may also push forward\nwith runs on the inside of the wing-backs, providing an option to cross from a\nnarrower position. With two players in central midfield, the wider centre-\nbacks often have space to dribble forwards. They are sometimes the players who\naccess the front three.\n\n**What are the players\u2019 out-of-possession responsibilities in a 3-4-3?  \n** A 3-4-3 will become a 5-2-3 or 5-4-1 when the team is out of possession.\nThe two wing-backs drop into defence to form a back line of five, and are\nresponsible for blocking crosses when the opposition move the ball out wide.\nWhen pressing high, they will jump forward and may even press as high as the\nopposition full-backs.\n\nThe three centre-backs cover central spaces, with the wider centre-backs\ntracking runs made in behind the wing-back on their side. When defending\nhigher up the pitch, the wider centre-backs may follow an attacker who drops\ninto midfield.\n\nThe double pivot stay connected to the back line to reduce spaces between the\nlines, particularly when the wing-backs are out of position and making\nrecovery runs. They may push forward to support a high press. When a team sets\nup with two number 10s, the double pivot are crucial to providing defensive\ncover in case the press is beaten.\n\nThe front three screen passes into midfield or press high, often with the aim\nof forcing play into wide areas. If they can lock play by the touchline, they\ncan work together to crowd the opposition out.\n\n**Which teams and coaches have used a 3-4-3 well?**\n\n**Gareth Southgate, England**  \nSouthgate has often used a back three with England, with Kyle Walker playing\nas the right-sided centre-back (below). In this shape, he likes his wing-backs\nto have good crossing ability. He expects them to push forward into crossing\npositions, and also combine out wide with the two narrow 10s. Southgate has\nalso used a wider front line, with the wide forwards rotating with the wing-\nbacks.\n\n**Antonio Conte, Chelsea**  \nConte won the Premier League and FA Cup using a 3-4-3 with Diego Costa\nsupported by two inside forwards (below). Chelsea\u2019s attackers would often\nstart wide and then either dribble infield or make penetrating runs off the\nball in behind. He often used a combative midfield pairing in N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and\nNemanja Matic, although Cesc F\u00e0bregas provided a more technical option when\nConte wanted his team to dominate the ball. Marcos Alonso and Victor Moses\nprovided width and height from wing-back, completing a front five when in\npossession.\n\n**Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham and Southampton  \n** Pochettino often used an attacking 3-4-3 shape converted from a 4-3-3\nstarting formation. Pochettino\u2019s single pivot dropped into the back line,\nsplitting the two centre-backs. The full-backs pushed forward as wing-backs,\nthe number eights held their positions and the wingers moved inside to support\nthe centre-forward. Alternatively, one of the number eights pushed forward,\nwith a number 10 or inside forward dropping (below).\n\n**Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea  \n** Tuchel employs a 3-4-3 shape in which Chelsea\u2019s wing-backs push forward and\nrotate with the two number 10s to get into goalscoring positions. Reece James,\nMarcos Alonso and Ben Chilwell all play a significant role in the final third\n(below), while the likes of Mason Mount and Hakim Ziyech drop or move wide.\nTuchel has sometimes used a winger \u2013 such as Callum Hudson-Odoi \u2013 in the wing-\nback positions. This adds a more natural attacking presence to the in-\npossession front line of five.\n\n**What are the benefits of playing with a 3-4-3?  \n** The 3-4-3 provides good balance between attack and defence. It commits five\noutfield players to attacks, while the other five cover underneath and focus\nmore on defending.\n\nA pair of narrow 10s can help create central overloads against an opposition\nmidfield two or three, and work to counter-press after a loss of possession.\n\nWide forwards can combine with the wing-backs to create overloads out wide,\nand help pin opposing full-backs in deep positions. Wing-backs joining the\nattack creates a wide front line of five that can stretch the opposition\ndefensive line across the pitch. This works to create more space in central\nareas.\n\nThe double pivot and back three provide a strong base against counter-attacks\nthrough the centre of the pitch. In a set block, the back line of five and two\nmidfielders provide excellent defensive security, especially in central areas.\n\n**What are the disadvantages to playing with a 3-4-3?  \n** Opposition counter-attacks can target wide areas, as the back line of three\ncovers less space across the pitch than a back four. The central midfield\npair, meanwhile, can be overloaded following a defensive transition.\n\nAs the 3-4-3 often uses two number 10s, there is also a significant physical\ndemand on the wing-backs. In this formation, they need to contribute at both\nends of the pitch constantly.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?

The first \u2013 a double pivot \u2013 protects the\ncentral spaces ahead of the defence, and the second \u2013 a more advanced pair \u2013\nprimarily operates between the lines, in support of two centre-forwards.\n\n**Where does the 4-2-2-2 originate?**  \nThe 4-2-2-2 formation, sometimes referred to as the \u201cmagic box\u201d, \u201cmagic\nrectangle\u201d, or \u201cmagic square\u201d, is thought to have first been used in 1950s\nBrazil, where Fl\u00e1vio Costa focused on free, fluid and improvised attacking\nplay.\n\nFrench manager Albert Batteux then used the 4-2-2-2 structure in winning eight\nLigue 1 titles \u2013 the most by any manager \u2013 in the 1950s with Reims and the\n1960s with Saint-\u00c9tienne.\n\nThe 4-2-2-2 system was then used most prominently in South America, although\nthe France national side won Euro 1984 using it.\n\n**What are the players\u2019 in-possession responsibilities in a 4-2-2-2?**  \nThe full-backs provide the team's attacking width in a 4-2-2-2, often moving\nahead of the double pivot. The centre-backs use the double pivot to build from\nthe back, while also breaking lines with passes into the attacking midfielders\nwhen possible.\n\nThe double pivot supports attacks underneath the ball, and provides cover\ninside and behind the advanced full-backs. One of the players in the double\npivot may drop into the back line after the full-backs have pushed forward to\ncreate a back three. Alternatively, one of them may provide a delayed forward\nrun to join the attack.\n\nThe number 10s are the primary creators, and both the most interesting and\nunique aspect of the 4-2-2-2. They aim to get into positions between the lines\nto pick up the ball (above). They link the defence and double pivot to the\ncentre-forwards, while also offering an additional goal threat, bursting\nforward during counter-attacks and subsequent moves to pick up second balls\nand shoot from distance. It\u2019s also common to see the 10s moving wide to\nsupport the advanced full-backs. They may deliver crosses or make decoy runs\nto create space for the full-back to cross.\n\nThe centre-forwards stay highest, and are responsible for creating and\nfinishing chances. They occupy the opposing centre-backs, link play with\nmidfield runners, attack crosses, through balls and cut-backs, and stretch the\nopposition by threatening the space in behind. One of the two strikers may\ndrop short to create space for a midfielder to run in behind, but they mostly\nremain central and high up the pitch.\n\n**What are the players\u2019 out-of-possession responsibilities in a 4-2-2-2?**  \nThe back line of four sets up like any other back four, staying compact and\nprotecting the spaces closest to goal. However, the full-backs may push\nforward to press an opponent. When one does so, the centre-backs and far-side\nfull-back slide across the pitch to cover.\n\nThe double pivot protects the central spaces in front of the centre-backs, but\nwill push forward to support a high press if the manager wants them to. They\nwill also be responsible for tracking runs from opposition midfielders beyond\nthe midfield line.\n\nThe number 10s are likely to take up a narrow defensive position, staying\nclose to the double pivot. When their team drops back into a block, they may\nmove alongside the double pivot to form a second line of four and create a\n4-4-2 block. When pressing high, the attacking midfielders could still start\nnarrow, before moving to press the opposition full-backs or wing-backs in an\nattempt to lock play near the touchline with a curved press (above).\nAlternatively, the two 10s could press inwards, along with the centre-\nforwards, in an attempt to show the opposition into the crowded central area\nof the pitch. Here, the double pivot will then try and win the ball.\n\nThe centre-forwards are responsible for instigating the high press, and then\napplying pressure from behind the ball to stop the opponent from turning out\nand recycling possession. If the aim is to force play towards the touchline,\nthe centre-forwards will press outwards and try to prevent the opposition from\nswitching play.\n\n**The best modern examples of teams using a 4-2-2-2**\n\n**Manuel Pellegrini, with several clubs**  \nManuel Pellegrini has used a 4-2-2-2 at Real Madrid, Villarreal, Manchester\nCity and Real Betis, often converting from a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-4-2 in games. With\nReal Madrid, he used two of Cristiano Ronaldo, Ra\u00fal, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo\nHigua\u00edn up front, with two number 10s selected from Kak\u00e1, Esteban Granero,\nGuti and Rafael van der Vaart. The team\u2019s attacking width was provided by\noverlapping runs from Marcelo and \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa \u2013 or Sergio Ramos, used as a\nright-back \u2013 while Xabi Alonso and Lassana Diarra played as the double pivot\n(below).\n\n**Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, with RB Leipzig and Southampton**  \nHasenh\u00fcttl has used a 4-2-2-2 shape in both attack and defence, with an\naggressive counter-pressing out-of-possession approach and direct, central\ncounter-attacks. With Southampton, the width has been provided by right-backs\nKyle Walker-Peters or Tino Livramento, who pushed forward (below), while Danny\nIngs and Ch\u00e9 Adams formed an impressive and dynamic centre-forward partnership\nin the 2020/21 season. One of them would drop short, while the right-sided\nattacking midfielder then pushed higher. The left-sided number 10, meanwhile,\ntook up a wider position, giving more room for one of the double pivot to push\nforward on that side. The left-back tended to be more reserved than the right-\nback.\n\n**Ralf Rangnick, with RB Leipzig and Manchester United**  \nEarly in his Manchester United reign, Ralf Rangnick used a 4-2-2-2 structure\nwith Cristiano Ronaldo up front alongside Marcus Rashford (bottom). Bruno\nFernandes has continued as a number 10, but has more responsibility through\nthe inside channels, with Jadon Sancho used in a much narrower role than he\nhad previously played for England or Borussia Dortmund. The full-backs\nconsistently push forward, with Scott McTominay and Fred forming a familiar\ndouble pivot to support the press from deep.\n\n**What are the benefits of playing with a 4-2-2-2?**  \nThe 4-2-2-2 shape can help create central overloads in dangerous positions\naround the opposition\u2019s central midfielders, leading to frequent progress\nthrough the centre of the pitch.\n\nWhen playing against a back four, both opposing centre-backs are occupied by\nthe two centre-forwards. This discourages them from stepping into midfield to\ncompete for the ball, which can help the two attacking midfielders receive in\nhigher positions.\n\nThe presence of a double pivot enables the full-backs to attack simultaneously\nwithout the need for complex rotations or positional changes to add numbers in\ncentral midfield.\n\nThe 4-2-2-2 is a good shape from which a team can counter-press centrally, and\nalso launch counter-attacks. This is because, without many movements or\nrotations, there should be significant numbers around the ball when possession\nis lost centrally.\n\nThe 4-2-2-2 also provides lots of defensive support and cover through central\nspaces, which is ideal for protecting goal in a mid-block. It also lends\nitself to forcing the opposition wide when they have the ball.\n\n**What are the disadvantages to playing with a 4-2-2-2?  \n** The 4-2-2-2 lacks natural width in attack, so wider counter-attacks are\nrare. As a result, additional movements from the central players are often\nrequired.\n\nThe centre-backs are required to cover the wide areas whenever the double\npivot can\u2019t get across once the full-backs have pushed forward. This can lead\nto a detached back line, especially when dealing with quick, direct counter-\nattacks when the full-backs have advanced.\n\nA team in a 4-2-2-2 can be vulnerable to accurate switches of play, with the\nwide areas left open much of the time.\n\nThe 4-2-2-2 is best suited to counter-attacking and threatening on transition,\nand is less effective during sustained periods of possession. In this\nscenario, players can block one another off due to being on the same vertical\npassing line, especially in central areas.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?

The implication is that his players move from their\npositions so much that the stated formation they start in does not in fact\nmatter. The players are so rarely in that shape that there is barely any need\nto name the formation.\n\nHowever, to most of us, formations provide a useful framework from which we\nstart to build up an idea of how a certain team or manager plays. So, we've\ndecided to take a look at football's most popular formations. Why would any\nmanager prefer one over another? What are the strengths and weaknesses of\neach? Read on to find out, and then draw your own conclusions as to which\nworks best.\n\n**4-3-3**\n\n**Strengths**  \nThe main strength of a 4-3-3 is the presence of a third player in central\nmidfield, which creates a numerical overload when up against a team playing\nwith two. This helps in build-up, playing through the lines, creating chances\nand overall domination of possession. The basic shape of a 4-3-3 tends to\ncreate more triangles between players, and so more passing lanes are open to\nthe ball-carrier. This, in theory at least, makes it easier to play a\npossession-based game \u2013 and this is one reason Johan Cruyff preferred such a\nshape for the positional game he liked his teams to play. Zinedine Zidane's\nReal Madrid had plenty of success in a 4-3-3, too.\n\nIn attack, wide wingers flanking a single centre-forward can be enough to pin\nfour defenders back. This creates an overload elsewhere on the pitch and\nshould, in theory, make it easier to progress up the pitch.\n\nDefensively, the 4-3-3 provides numbers and compactness in central areas. A\nstaggered midfield shape \u2013 often a single pivot behind two number eights \u2013\nmakes it easier to defend the space between the defensive and midfield lines.\nIt is easier to press high up the pitch, meanwhile, with three players in the\nfront line rather than two.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \nThe main weakness of a 4-3-3 is that the single centre-forward can be left\nisolated, and is naturally underloaded whether playing against two or three\ncentre-backs. This means you need a player in this position who is willing to\ndo lots of work that may bring little or no reward. They also need to be\nstrong and good enough on the ball to hold off several defenders.\n\nThe three central midfielders can end up numerically overloaded against four\ncentral players \u2013 for example, in a 4-4-2 diamond. The central midfielders can\nalso end up with a lot of ground to cover. If they don\u2019t get across the pitch\nfollowing a switch of play, the full-backs can be left exposed and isolated\nwith no wide midfielder ahead of them, and the winger usually high up the\npitch. Opponents can also target wide areas on the counter-attack,\nparticularly if a full-back has pushed up.\n\n**4-4-2**\n\n**Strengths**  \nThe presence of two centre-forwards in a 4-4-2 formation means both opposition\ncentre-backs are constantly occupied when up against a back four.\n\nThe 4-4-2 provides a strong base from which to launch counter-attacks, with a\ngood balance of players both in front of and behind the ball. There are\nusually enough players behind or around the ball to regain possession in the\nfirst place, and then also enough of a presence ahead of play to initiate and\nsustain a counter-attack, both in central and wide areas.\n\nAfter dropping back into a block, the front two can block off access to\ncentral midfield, making it harder for opponents to build through the centre\nof pitch.\n\nOne final strength \u2013 which is significant for proponents of the 4-4-2 like\nDiego Simeone \u2013 is that sliding across the pitch in two units of four is easy\nto do while maintaining compactness.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \nThe 4-4-2 requires lots of hard work, runs and movement from the players,\nbecause the basic structure is not the most conducive to playing a passing\ngame. Players in a rigid 4-4-2 structure can block teammates from passing to\none another, particularly when playing forwards. For example, a central\ndefender, central midfielder and centre-forward would all be on the same\npassing line. Without the required movements, this formation can become more\npredictable than others.\n\nWith two flat lines of four and no depth to midfield, spaces between the lines\ncan be difficult to cover. One penetrative pass can therefore cut several\nplayers out of the game quickly. A central-midfield two will also often face a\nnumerical overload, as plenty of opponents will set up with a midfield three.\n\n**4-2-3-1**\n\n**Strengths**  \nWith the number 10 able to drop into midfield when the team in possession, a\nteam playing in a 4-2-3-1 can create numerical overloads in central midfield\nwhen up against a midfield two. This helps in build-up play, chance creation,\nplaying through the thirds and in any attempts to dominate possession. The\nnumber 10 can play a little higher than a central midfielder might in a 4-3-3.\nFrom that position, they can link the midfield and the attack. They are also\nable to find central spaces between the lines and away from pressure.\n\nThe support and security provided by a double pivot allows the full-backs to\npush forward more effectively. They will often do so at the same, which may\nnot be the case from a 4-3-3 formation. The defensive midfielders in a double\npivot also protect the spaces between the lines and ahead of the centre-backs.\nThey are able to move across to cover the wide areas more quickly and more\neffectively than a single pivot would be able to. This means they can get\nacross following a switch of play, or cover the spaces an advanced full-back\nleaves vacant.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \nThe use of a double pivot inevitably means one fewer attacking player. That\ncan result in too little central attacking presence once the ball has been\nmoved forwards.\n\nThe three central midfielders can be numerically overloaded against four\ncentral players, such as in a 4-4-2 diamond. If the number 10 does not drop in\nwhen out of possession, the double pivot can be overloaded by a midfield\nthree.\n\nMeanwhile, the wide areas can be left exposed to opposition counter-attacks.\nAccurate switches of play can leave the central midfield unit with too much\nground to cover to get across.\n\n**4-4-2 diamond**\n\n**Strengths**  \nThe main strength of a midfield diamond is that it allows a team to have four\nplayers in central midfield. That will almost always mean a numerical overload\nagainst any other formation in a crucial part of the pitch.\n\nThe formation also allows you to play with two centre-forwards, who can always\noccupy both centre-backs in a back four. If you are up against a back three\nand the opposition has a one-player advantage in that part of the pitch, they\nare very unlikely to match up numerically in central midfield.\n\nThe four-player midfield unit provides a staggered defensive shape that makes\nit easier to defend spaces between the lines, and gives numbers in central\nareas. The front two, meanwhile, can either block off central access, or press\nthe outside shoulders of the opposition centre-backs. This cuts off the full-\nbacks and forces play into central midfield, where there are lots of\ndefenders.\n\nWhen defending for prolonged periods, a mobile midfield diamond can lock play\nnear a touchline better than most other formations.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \nUnless the full-backs push forward when the team is in possession, there will\nbe an obvious and distinct lack of width in attack.\n\nOut of possession, the wide areas can also give the opposition a target to\ncounter-attack into. Quick, accurate switches of play over the central\nmidfield unit can leave the full-backs underloaded. This means the nearest\ncentral midfielder has to get across quickly. They may have to make lateral\nruns constantly when out of possession, leaving them fatigued when play is\nturned over and they are needed in attack.\n\n**3-5-2**\n\n**Strengths**  \nThe midfield unit of five in a 3-5-2 formation provides both width to build\naround the opposition and numbers in central midfield to play through them,\nwithout the need for much in the way of movement or rotations. The three\ncentral midfielders can draw opponents into the middle of the pitch, before\nplay is then spread wide to the wing-backs. They can then provide width on\nboth sides at the same time.\n\nTwo centre-forwards can constantly occupy both opposing centre-backs in a back\nfour. High wing-backs and one or two attacking midfielders can mean extra\nnumbers in the final third, and a strong attacking threat.\n\nIn defence, three centre-backs provide numerical overloads against two centre-\nforwards. The back line can also quickly change from three to a five when the\nwing-backs drop. In possession, the three-player defence gives a strong\nfoundation to build from. It doesn\u2019t require any adjustments to have an\noverload in the first line, whether up against one or two centre-forwards.\n\nThe midfield three and front two can cover the central spaces well when out of\npossession, with lots of depth to plug gaps.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \nOnce the defence converts into a line of five, the wide areas in midfield are\ninevitably conceded. This allows the opposition to progress further up the\npitch on the flanks.\n\nThe wing-backs are required to be more versatile and well-rounded players than\neither full-back or wingers in back-four systems, as they are needed almost\nconstantly at both ends of the pitch. They also need to be _extremely_ fit to\ncover a vast amount of ground.\n\nIf the opposition builds through the inside channels, the wider centre-backs\ncan be drawn out of position, leaving gaps for penetrative runs in behind.\n\nWith the wing-backs often on their own out wide, it is difficult to create\nwide overloads in possession. It is also easier for opponents to isolate them\nin the defensive phase. If another player gets across to help the wing-back,\nthat creates a gap elsewhere in the structure.\n\n**3-4-3**\n\n**Strengths**  \nIf the two wide players in the front three play as wide number 10s, they can\ndrop into midfield to create a box or diamond structure that creates overloads\nin central midfield. The presence of two number 10s adds another threat\nbetween the lines, which can occupy both players in a double pivot or drag a\ncentre-back out if up against a single pivot.\n\nA wider front three can also pin a back four, which creates an overload\nelsewhere on the pitch. A wider front line can also create overloads along\nwith an advancing wing-back.\n\nOut of possession, the back line can quickly change from a three to a five via\nthe wing-backs withdrawing, adding extra presence in the back line. A narrow\nfront three can block central access even more effectively than a pair of\ncentre-forwards. They can also initiate a high press effectively.\n\n**Weaknesses**  \nOnce the defence converts into a line of five, the wide spaces in midfield are\ninevitably conceded. This allows the opposition to progress further up the\npitch in wide areas.\n\nThe wing-backs are required to be more versatile and well-rounded players than\neither full-back or wingers in back-four systems, as they are needed almost\nconstantly at both ends of the pitch. They also need to be extremely fit to\ncover a vast amount of ground.\n\nIf the opposition builds through the inside channels, the wider centre-backs\ncan be drawn out of position, leaving gaps for penetrative runs in behind.\n\nOnce the wide forwards move forward, there is less presence in midfield. As a\nresult, there are fewer players able to support the wing-backs if they are\nisolated.\n\n_To learn more from the professional coaches_  _of  The Coaches\u2019 Voice, visit\nCV Academy_\n\n## Get coaching updates\n\nNew coaching sessions, tactical analysis and insights from leading coaches,\nplus news from the coaching industry, delivered to your inbox.\n\n**Subscribe to regular Coaches\u2019 Voice newsletters**\n\nCoaching Licence UEFA PRO UEFA A UEFA B UEFA C Grassroots\n\nSubscribe\n\n## Elsewhere on CV\n\nCoaching Session\n\n### Birmingham City Under-16: Runs in behind \u2013 Midfield & defensive unit work\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Downloadable session plans\n\nCV Academy\n\n### Coaching Sessions\n\nMBP Coaches' School\n\n### Specialist in Set Pieces\n\nEnquiry\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookie Policy\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nGlossary\n\n(C) Coaches' voice 2025\\.

Stemming from tweaks to the 4-4-2 formation, and initially\nmost popular in Spain, the 4-2-3-1 steadily grew in popularity in major\nleagues from the 2000s onwards. It has since been used with success by many\nprominent coaches, including Pep Guardiola, Arne Slot and Erik ten Hag.\n\nBelow, our UEFA-licensed coaches have outlined the key aspects of the 4-2-3-1,\nas well as the positional requirements necessary for this formation to be used\nsuccessfully.\n\n## Central protection\n\nA key aspect of the 4-2-3-1 is that it provides significant central protection\nahead of the back line, with a particular focus on the spaces just in front of\nthe two centre-backs (below). Should the opposition play two central forwards,\nor a nine and 10 pairing, the double pivot in a 4-2-3-1 can screen, block and\nback-press any attempted passes.\n\nBecause zone 14 (click here to read more about this) is one of the most\nexploited areas of the pitch by attackers, the double pivot can help reduce\ndirect access into this space. At the same time, the pivots are well\npositioned to force play away from the centre.\n\nThe 4-2-3-1 often requires defensive midfielders who can duel, tackle and\nintercept in regular individual battles. These midfielders should also be\nalert enough to land on any second balls, especially when the back line has\nwon the first contact.\n\nThe defensive midfielders in a 4-2-3-1 must also have explosive acceleration\nand deceleration to help cover, screen or duel, as well as reposition.\nPositional changes in the middle of the pitch \u2013 relative to the position of\nthe ball and any subsequent attacking movements \u2013 are crucial. Once the ball\nhas been regained, calmness and composure in the first few passes are required\nto maintain possession \u2013 especially when facing an aggressive counter-press.\n\n## Front-line width\n\nThe front line in a 4-2-3-1 offers natural width, both during sustained\npossession and on the counter-attack. This is ideal for wingers who can\ndribble, carry the ball up the pitch and dominate in 1v1 situations. The\npositioning of the front three can also help pin a defensive unit of four\n(below), helping create overloads elsewhere on the pitch for deeper teammates\nto dominate and progress the ball forward.\n\nThe 4-2-3-1 requires wingers who can create with crosses and penetrative\npasses from wide areas. They must also be comfortable when receiving up\nagainst a touchline. Specific profiles of the wingers can vary, though;\ntraditional wingers can attack effectively on the outside of a 4-2-3-1, while\na wrong-footed winger can cause problems by working back inside.\n\nThe centre-forward must also be comfortable initially working alone, before\nthey are supported by the wide attackers, and the number 10 underneath. As\nthis forward role is often played in a 2v1 underload, clever positioning to\ncombine or disrupt the opposing back line is important.\n\n## Attacking full-backs\n\nThe full-backs can be given significant licence to attack in a 4-2-3-1, thanks\nto the presence of the double pivot. The 4-2-3-1 works well with full-backs\nwho are adept at crossing, in wide combinations, dribbling or driving forward,\nand also attacking the back post. Spaces either side of the number 10 are\nideal for wingers to roll inside, freeing wide space for the full-backs to\nmove into (below). This works to maintain width in the front line.\n\nThe double pivot can also support underneath full-back advances, covering and\nscreening should possession be lost. It is important that central protection\nstill exists in transition, though, with the deeper players locking any\ncounter-attacks to one side. Delaying progress up the pitch gives more time\nfor the advanced full-back(s) and others to recover back.\n\n## Number 10\n\nIn a 4-2-3-1, the number 10 can be the main, central point of the attack. They\nare often the key player between the lines \u2013 the link between building and\ncreating \u2013 and the primary source of attacking play. Giving freedom to the\nnumber 10 can prompt differing movements, rotations, patterns and\ncombinations, allowing the 10 to operate in various positions of the attack.\n\nDifferent types of number 10s can flourish within the 4-2-3-1. Germany\u2019s 2014\nWorld Cup winner Mesut \u00d6zil was a central creator between the lines, capable\nof slicing open defences with delicate through balls and combinations. It was\nvery rare to see him outside the width of the box.\n\nHis compatriot Thomas M\u00fcller (below) has also created plenty of chances as a\nnumber 10, but these have often been via crosses and passes across goal. He\nhas often made movements that pull defenders with him, freeing teammates in\nthe moments before he provides an assist.\n\nBelgium\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne has dominated the right inside channel playing for\nManchester City. There, he makes penetrative runs to cross, cut back or\nreverse balls into central goalscoring positions. Other 10s \u2013 such as Jamal\nMusiala, Paulo Dybala and Eberechi Eze \u2013 offer more of a dribbling threat.\nThey carry the ball and beat opponents 1v1 to then combine, create or score.\n\nIt can go unnoticed, but within the 4-2-3-1 the number 10 often does a\nsignificant amount of running \u2013 both with and without the ball. Repositioning\nis important when attacking, but when defending in a 4-2-3-1, it\u2019s often the\nnumber 10 who repositions most without the ball. The centre-forward remains\nhigh and narrow, ready to counter-attack, while the double pivot and back line\nremain solid and compact.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?

Mikel Arteta\u2019s\nArsenal, Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s Barcelona and J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool are among the\nhigh-profile exponents of the 4-3-3 shape. Other highly successful modern\ncoaches, including Carlo Ancelotti, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Luis\nEnrique, have also used a 4-3-3 at different times in their careers.\n\nAs well as being conducive to an offensive approach, the 4-3-3 also lends\nitself well to defensive adaptation. The shape allows for space to be covered\nefficiently, support to be provided defensively, and a press exerted across\nthe pitch.\n\nHere, The Coaches\u2019 Voice highlights five keys to executing a 4-3-3 formation\nsuccessfully.\n\n## **Specialists**\n\nFor a 4-3-3 to be executed effectively, players in the midfield and attacking\nlines need to possess particular attributes.\n\nThe three midfield players must offer passing lanes in the first two thirds of\nthe pitch, behind the opposition press, as well as making diagonal runs. In\nthe 4-3-3, the midfielders tend to play in the congested central channel. As a\nresult, they must have excellent technique on the ball.\n\nThe attacking line typically consists of players with the profile of three\nforwards, or two wingers and a striker. Regardless of the combination, all\nthree players must be clearly offensive. If these positions are played by\nmidfielders or number eights, the 4-3-3 will carry less attacking threat.\n\nThe three attacking players have two key functions. In possession, they must\nprovide width to receive in the final third, giving options outside and\nlooking to make runs inside. Out of possession, as the first line of defence,\nthey must press aggressively against the build-up. If they don\u2019t, the\nopposition can potentially advance with ease (below).\n\n## **Creating space in the build-up**\n\nWhen building from the back in a 4-3-3, the goalkeeper and defenders must be\npatient in order to draw the press and filter passes to the midfielders.\nHaving these three midfielders at different heights is advantageous to finding\nspace and progressing the ball.\n\nWith the pivot closer to the defensive line as an axis of the play, they must\nlook to draw the opposition press. Sergio Busquets at Barcelona was a\nfantastic example of this. His movements in front of the centre-backs\ngenerated space for both the full-backs and inside players, such as Gavi,\nFranck Kessi\u00e9 or Sergi Roberto (below).\n\nIf the pivot is marked, the two number eights must find space to receive in a\nposition where they can progress the ball. Should the opposition press also\nreach the number eights, the height of the full-backs can be key to generating\noverloads and free players.\n\nOnce in the opposition half, the width of the wingers forces the opposition to\ncommit players to close them down. This can create space in the final third,\nwhich can be exploited to create chances on goal.\n\n## **Width in attack**\n\nThe 4-3-3 is a system that thrives on wide play. To achieve this, a high level\nof co-ordination is required between the full-backs and the wingers. It is a\npartnership that can work in two ways.\n\nOne is to play a winger on the side that corresponds with their dominant foot\n\u2013 left-footed on the left wing, right-footed on the right side. This tends to\nprovoke more 1v1s and forces a more conservative opposition full-back deeper.\nThat means less risk after a turnover in that area, with full-backs typically\nless pivotal to building attacks than advanced teammates. It also increases\nthe chances of having numbers behind the ball on a defensive transition.\n\nThe second option is to have an inverted winger who is more inclined to cut\ninside. This leaves space on the outside to be exploited by a full-back and\ncreate a possible 2v1. On defensive transition, however, there is less\nprotection when losing possession. As such, the midfielders must be ready to\nprevent quick progression on transition.\n\nArsenal (below) are a good example of the full-back-winger combination in\nattack. The positioning and movement of the wingers (often Bukayo Saka and\nGabriel Martinelli) and the full-backs (mostly Oleksandr Zinchenko, Ben White\nor Takehiro Tomiyasu) provides variation in outside-channel attacks.\n\n## Counter-attacking speed\n\nThe 4-3-3 lends itself to rapid counter-attacking, for which the positioning\nof the forwards is key. Often they will be in a 3v4 underload, or a 3v3, so\nthey must quickly find the space in an attacking transition. As such,\nteammates should look for balls in behind the opposition defence for the\nforwards to run into space.\n\nVin\u00edcius J\u00fanior's pace in launching Real Madrid\u2019s counter-attacks, when Carlo\nAncelotti has used a 4-3-3, is a good example of speed on transition (below).\nThe Brazilian winger relishes finding space behind, while his teammate Rodrygo\nalso has a good understanding of these vertical movements in the moments after\npossession is won.\n\n## **Midfield defensive duties**\n\nThe 4-3-3 is a system, with its three attacking players, in which the first\nline of the press can be vulnerable. The three midfielders must therefore be\nswitched on and adept at shuffling across the width of the pitch, for those\nmoments when the first press is bypassed. This requires good endurance levels,\nas well as positional awareness.\n\nThe three midfielders must also be prepared to support the full-backs,\ncovering behind when they are defending wide areas where crosses can be\ndelivered. This prevents the centre-backs from having to come out of the box.\nThe midfielders must have good reading of the play, to understand when to drop\nto help the full-back.\n\nTogether, these side-to-side movements and support of the full-backs demands a\nhigh-level of co-ordination between the midfielders.\n\nDuring Klopp\u2019s time at Liverpool, his teams have often provided an excellent\nexample of midfield balance within a 4-3-3. While at Liverpool, Jordan\nHenderson\u2019s support of his full-back was vital in allowing the team\u2019s centre-\nbacks to mark inside the box (below).\n\nThe midfield line plays an important role in the defensive transition.\nWhenever possible, they should be positioned close to the ball to prevent an\nopposing counter-attack. They must be aggressive in disrupting the\nopposition\u2019s build-up as soon as the ball is lost. The aim should be to win\nthe ball back as quickly as possible, so that the team can attack again in the\n4-3-3 shape.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?

The\nclassic version was made up of four lines or units, with a back line of three\nbehind two half-backs. A pair of inside forwards then supported a front three,\nmaking up a 3-2-2-3 shape.\n\n**Where does the W-M originate?**  \nThe term W-M stems from the two shapes \u2013 or letters \u2013 formed when one line is\ndrawn between each of the members of the back five, and another between each\nof the front five. One resembles a W, and the other an M.\n\nThe idea for the W-M formation emerged after the Football Association changed\nthe offside law. The amendment dictated that only two defenders were required\nto play an opponent onside, as opposed to the three previously. This meant it\nwas easier for attackers to remain onside, so teams committed more players\nforward to attack. The W-M formation added another defender to try and\ncounteract these added numbers in attack.\n\nThe change to a W-M formation also helped teams deal with the three narrow\nattackers in the 2-3-5 shape. This \u2018pyramid\u2019 formation had been the standard\nformation in the early 20th century.\n\nA statue of Herbert Chapman, one of the earliest adopters of the W-M\nformation, stands outside Arsenal's Emirates Stadium **Michael Regan/Getty\nImages**\n\n**How is the W-M formation used in modern football?**  \nTeams no longer line up in a traditional W-M shape, but many will switch to a\nmodern version of the W-M when in possession. This is most common from the\n3-4-3 formation, when the two wing-backs push high and the two number 10s drop\noff, away from the striker and into midfield.\n\nA W-M can also be formed from a 4-3-3 structure, once the back four has\nconverted into a three. Here, one of the full-backs moves into midfield to\nform a double pivot. The two number eights then push forward to support the\nfront three, creating a 3-2-2-3 shape.\n\nThe main reason teams in the modern game use a W-M is to establish a structure\nthat can provide adequate cover and protection against counter-attacks without\nany drop in the quality of attacking build-up play, positioning and\npossession.\n\n**Which teams and managers have used a W-M?**\n\n**Herbert Chapman, Arsenal**  \nAlthough not necessarily the inventor of the W-M, Herbert Chapman (above) and\nhis Arsenal side of the 1930s are widely considered to have been the most\neffective at using the early version of the system. Placing the centre-half\nfrom the 2-3-5 between the two full-backs created a back three, with the two\nhalf-backs then narrowing ahead of them. The inside forward pair withdrew\nslightly, supporting a front three. The team was particularly effective on the\ncounter and had plenty of success under Chapman. They lifted the FA Cup in\n1930, before going on to win the First Division in both 1930/31 and 1932/33.\n\n**Pep Guardiola, Manchester City and Bayern Munich**  \nWith Bayern, Phillip Lahm moved infield from the full-back position, creating\na double pivot and leaving a back three in defence. At City, Jo\u00e3o Cancelo and\nOleksandr Zinchenko are used similarly.\n\nAt Bayern, Guardiola sometimes pushed both full-backs into pivot roles. The\nsingle pivot in his 4-3-3 \u2013 usually Toni Kroos \u2013 then dropped into the back\nline to split the centre-backs and form a three (above).\n\nAt City, Guardiola has also used a traditional midfielder \u2013 usually\nFernandinho \u2013 at centre-back in a back four, with the Brazilian moving out of\ndefence to become a second pivot during build-up (below). Both full-backs then\nstay in the back line to form a three.\n\n**Thomas Tuchel, Chelsea**  \nTuchel\u2019s starting 3-4-3 shape is often changed into a W-M structure in\npossession, as wing-backs \u2013 picked from Reece James, C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta, Marcos\nAlonso and Ben Chilwell \u2013 push very high, often as far as or even ahead of the\ncentre-forward. Mason Mount, Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz have operated as the\ninside forwards ahead of the double pivot (below). Unlike Guardiola\u2019s teams,\nno rotations are needed to form the three-man back line of the W-M, with the\nthree centre-backs simply remaining in place.\n\n**Roberto Mart\u00ednez, Belgium**  \nMart\u00ednez used a similar 3-4-3 structure to Tuchel at the 2018 World Cup and\nEuro 2020, with two narrow number 10s \u2013 usually selected from Eden Hazard,\nKevin De Bruyne and Dries Mertens \u2013 supporting Romelu Lukaku. The two 10s\noften start higher to support Lukaku after a pass is made into him, and also\nthen run beyond him. The wing-backs drop back towards the ball, slightly\nadapting the structure of the front line in the W-M shape.\n\n**What are the benefits of playing with a W-M?**  \nThe modern version of the W-M helps overload two or three central midfielders,\nwith a four-player box formed in the middle of the pitch. Further forward, the\nfront line of three can pin back a back four. This creates a free player, and\nso the potential for overloads elsewhere on the pitch.\n\nFrom a 4-3-3 or a 3-4-3, few movements are required during build-up to convert\ninto a W-M structure. This means little change is needed during defensive\ntransitions. The W-M also provides cover in central areas and protection\nagainst counter-attacks, without really hindering the attacking structure.\n\n**What are the disadvantages to playing with a W-M?**  \nThe W-M system requires a number of players to play different roles in and out\nof possession, often on different lines or in different areas of the pitch. As\na result, it demands extremely versatile players.\n\nMultiple passes are often required to establish full control of possession to\nallow teammates time to reposition. If these passes fail, the team may be\nvulnerable to counter-attacks.\n\nThe shape also leaves the wider areas vulnerable to counter-attacks before\nconverting back into the original defensive shape.\n\n**How does a W-M formation differ when in and out of possession?**  \nThe idea for the modern W-M in possession is to create triangles and diamonds\nbetween teammates, which in turn forges diagonal passing lines to progress\nplay up the pitch. The highest and widest players \u2013 the wingers or wing-backs\n\u2013 aim to stretch the pitch as much as possible, and either receive in space or\npull the opposition defence apart to create space centrally for others to\nreceive.\n\nIn the modern game, it is common for teams to attack with five players across\nthe width of the pitch. The W-M provides the perfect foundations for that, as\nthe wide forwards and wing-backs push high to join the centre-forward.\n\nPushing this many players forward also means teams are in a good position to\ncounter-press if possession is lost. The attacking midfielders can join in to\ncrowd central spaces at defensive transitions, while the front three often\npress aggressively.\n\nOut of possession, teams no longer use the W-M shape like they used to.\nInstead, they convert into a back four or five through defenders making\nrecovery runs.\n\n_Want to know more about football tactics and learn how to coach from the very\nbest?
